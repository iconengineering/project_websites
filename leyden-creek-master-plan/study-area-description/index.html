<p>The Leyden Creek watershed has a drainage area of approximately 11.8 square
miles, located in the City of Arvada and unincorporated Jefferson
County. The watershed is bounded to the north by the Little Dry Creek
(ADCO) and Big Dry Creek (ADCO) watersheds and to the south by Ralston
Creek. Leyden Creek, approximately 10.5 miles in length, ranges in
elevation from 5420 feet at the confluence with Ralston Creek south of
72<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and Simms Street to 7648 feet at the upstream watershed
limits. The watershed has an average slope of approximately 2.9%. The
UDFCD Reuse number for the Leyden Creek watershed is 4308. The extents
of the project area can be seen in <a href="#figure-2-1-vicinity-map">Figure 2-1</a>.</p>
<p>Downstream of Leyden Lake, the watershed primarily consists of
residential development. Although the majority of the basin upstream of
Leyden Lake is undeveloped, new development is ongoing and includes both
residential and industrial areas. Undeveloped open space is also
prevalent within the Arvada city limits and within Jefferson County.</p>
<p>Current development includes two large planned residential developments,
both located upstream of Leyden Lake. The Leyden Rock development is
located north of W 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue at Quaker Street extending west to the
Jefferson County landfill. Leyden Ranch West is located directly to the
east of Leyden Rock. Based on input from project sponsors these two
developments were assumed to be fully built out since they were under
construction at the time of this study. Planned development Leyden Ranch
East is also forthcoming; however since it is not currently under
construction it was not considered built for the existing condition
analysis.</p>
<p>The majority of the watershed is comprised of Type C soil as defined by
the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Type A, Type B, Type
D soil are also present within the watershed. A soil map of the
watershed can be found in <a href="../appendix-b"><em>APPENDIX B – Hydrologic Analysis</em></a>.</p>
<p>Although there are several detention facilities in the watershed, only
four met criteria to be considered for flood reduction purposes in this
study. Leyden Lake, providing the most storage of these facilities, is
located near the center of the watershed. Upstream of Leyden Lake, a
regional pond exists and will be formalized in the location of an
existing sump downstream of the Leyden Ranch West development. The other
two ponds included in the study are at Ralston Valley High School and at
Lamplighter Park.</p>
<p>There are three major canals that flow through the project area,
including the Church Ditch, Farmers’ High Line Canal, and Croke Canal.
All three of these canals convey irrigation water from Clear Creek north
to their distribution locations. Leyden Creek crosses the Church Ditch
upstream of Leyden Lake and downstream of Quaker Street. The Farmers’
High Line Canal is located directly downstream of Leyden Lake. The Croke
Canal is located downstream of Indiana Street and also upstream of the
Cameo Estates neighborhood. Canals were considered to be flowing full at
the time of the storm for the hydrologic analysis.</p>

<h2 id="22-land-use">2.2 Land Use<a class="headerlink" href="#22-land-use" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Land use was determined by zoning data provided by project sponsors in
GIS format and the City of Arvada’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan. As
directed by project sponsors, the Land Use Plan was prioritized over the
zoning information in conflicting areas.</p>
<p>To determine existing conditions, aerial imagery was used to compare to
zoning data. When zoning data did not correlate with existing
structures, the zoning shapefiles were divided to better represent
existing conditions. This was more prevalent in Jefferson County where
existing development overlapped with agricultural zones. Table RO-3 of
the Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual (USDCM) was used to select
impervious values for each land use type. For residential development,
Figures RO-3, RO-4, RO-5 (USDCM) were utilized to determine impervious
percentages.</p>

<p>The Jefferson County landfill located east of Hwy 93 and north of W.
82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue was assigned an impervious value of 15 %. This value was
selected after project sponsor agreement based on soil conditions
consistent with landfill cover and operations. This value also maintains
consistency with hydrology submitted for ongoing FEMA update studies.
The Pioneer Sand Company, located south of W. 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue, was assumed
to have an open space impervious value. The existing conditions land use
map can be found in <a href="../appendix-b"><em>APPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis</em></a>.</p>
<p>For the future land use conditions, impervious values anticipate future
development based on land use and zoning information collected from
project sponsors. Consideration was given to current land-use, where it
exceeded future projections based on zoning. In general, the future
conditions percent impervious values exceed those developed for previous
studies. Downstream of Leyden Lake the watershed is primarily developed,
resulting in similar land use for both existing and future conditions.
Upstream of the reservoir higher impervious values resulted from the
planned development areas and industrial locations.</p>
<p>Through discussions with project sponsors,
the area west of Highway 93, and south of Highway 72, zoned commercial
and industrial in Arvada, was replaced with open space based on the land
use plan. The future conditions land use map can be found in <a href="../appendix-b"><em>APPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="23-reach-description">2.3 Reach Description<a class="headerlink" href="#23-reach-description" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>For the purposes of this study Leyden Creek was divided into four
reaches. Descriptions of each reach are provided below and can be seen

Leyden Lake an approximate detail (Zone A) floodplain exists for Leyden
Creek and a small portion of Barbara Gulch near the confluence with
Leyden Creek.</p>

<em>Leyden Creek at W 82<sup>nd</sup> Ave.</em></p>
<p>Reach 4 consist primarily of a natural
channel on undeveloped land. The creek meanders approximately 3.3 miles
during this reach, starting at Highway 93 crossing W 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and
Quaker St. prior to entering Leyden Lake, downstream. The Leyden Rock
and Leyden Ranch West residential developments are currently under
construction north of W. 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue. These developments will
contribute flows upstream of the Leyden Creek crossing with Quaker St.
in the Leyden Townsite subdivision.</p>
<h2 id="24-flood-history">2.4 Flood History<a class="headerlink" href="#24-flood-history" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>There is limited information on any flooding along Leyden Creek prior to
the September 2013 flood event. Past hydrology studies noted severe
flooding may have been likely, only went unrecorded. The 2009 UDFCD
Ralston Creek Flood Warning Plan also did not identify past flooding
events on Leyden Creek</p>
<p>There are two UDFCD stream gages located within the Leyden Creek
watershed. Stream Gage 203 - Leyden Reservoir Water PT was installed in
December 2002 located in Leyden Lake. The maximum discharge of 1,351 cfs
from this gage was recorded on September 12, 2013. Stream Gage 213 –
Leyden Confluence was installed May 1988 located east of Simms St near
the confluence with Ralston Creek. The record high water for this
location occurred August 6, 1995 with a peak flow of 3,520 cfs. In their
2014 report on the flooding events of Leyden Creek, Water and Earth
Technologies Inc. (WET) suggested Stream Gage 213 is recalibrated due to
what they believed to be an overestimation of flows compared to their
analysis of high water marks.</p>
<p>WET also reported the following regarding the September 2013 flood:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At Blue Mountain Road, a plugged culvert beneath Blue Mountain Road
    caused flows normally contributing to Coal Creek watershed to enter
    the Leyden Creek basin. A peak flow of 280 cfs was estimated to pass
    through the railroad embankment, eroding Blue Mountain Road where
    the culvert was plugged. The erosion was repaired using 2,000 tons
    of fill material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leyden Road (W. 82<sup>nd</sup> Ave) was overtopped by as much as three feet
    at the Leyden Creek crossing. During the event the road was closed
    between Indiana St. to Highway 93.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quaker Street was overtopped with erosion bursting a 12” water main.
    The water supply was reconfigured and there was not a sustained
    interruption of drinking water. Peak discharges from high water
    marks were estimated to be between the 10-yr and 50-yr levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Church Ditch embankment breached at the crossing with Leyden
    Creek, diverting flows to Leyden Lake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The outflow at Leyden Lake was recorded at 1,351 cfs much higher
    than the previously estimated 100-yr release rate of 373 cfs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indiana Street was overtopped prior to receiving spillway flows. The
    roadway was ultimately inundated by up to a foot in depth.
    Improvements were made from the existing 36- and 18-inch pipes to
    triple (3) 36-inch CMPs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Croke Canal intercepted flow from Leyden Creek when Leyden
    overtopped the upstream canal embankment. Overtopping occurred at
    Eldridge St. and W. 78<sup>th</sup> Place near Cameo Estates. An intentional
    breach was made at the Leyden Creek crossing to prevent
    breaches elsewhere. Breaching the canal resulted in a second, lower
    flood peak on Leyden Creek impacting areas previously flooded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cameo Estates is located between Eldrige St. and Alkire St. Several
    residences were damaged, along with flooding in pastures, yards,
    and streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alkire St was overtopped from W. 78<sup>th</sup> Avenue to W. 74<sup>th</sup> Drive
    and was closed for safety reasons during the storm. There was
    significant flood inundation within the Youth Memorial Park/Sports
    Complex, and likely reduced downstream discharges.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the flow was much higher than the expected 100-yr release rates
at Leyden Lake, several of the reaches downstream of the lake did not
experience flows on that same order of magnitude. The bridge on W.
72<sup>nd</sup> Ave was not overtopped during the flood as was the bridge at
Simms St. These structures were originally sized for a 100-yr event.</p>
