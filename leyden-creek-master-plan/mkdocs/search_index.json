Notice to proceed for Agreement No.\n14-03.06 with ICON Engineering, Inc. was provided by UDFCD on March 26,\n2014. Although not a sponsor, Jefferson County was a significant\nstakeholder and participant in this study.\n\n\n1.2 Purpose and Scope\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe purpose of this study is to provide updated hydrologic information\nfor Leyden Creek. The watershed is bounded to the south by the Ralston\nCreek watershed, to the north by both Big Dry Creek and Little Dry Creek\nwatersheds. The majority of the Leyden Creek watershed is located within\nthe City of Arvada with the remaining areas lying within unincorporated\nJefferson County.\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the scope of work for this study:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate meetings with UDFCD and project stakeholders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObtain and review previously developed hydrologic information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview and provide adjustments to land use parameters based on\n    obtained land use, zoning maps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine subwatershed boundaries and parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop existing and future conditions hydrologic models utilizing\n    the UDFCD Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP) v.1.4.3\n    spreadsheet and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Storm\n    Water Management Model (EPA SWMM) v. 5.0.022 for the 2-, 5-, 10-,\n    25-, 50-, and 100-year recurrence intervals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Planning Process\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe planning process began with reviewing previous studies for the\nLeyden Creek watershed. Hydrology was originally developed as part of\nRalston/Leyden Creek Major Drainageway Plan dated September 1977. An\nupdate to the hydrology was completed prior to the Ralston Creek \u2013\nLeyden Creek FHAD dated June 2004.\n\n\nProgress meetings were held to discuss the project status and\nmethodology with stakeholders. Minutes for all meetings held during the\nproject can be found in \nAPPENDIX A - Project Correspondence (PDF version only)\n.\n\n\nMarch 20, 2014 Project Kickoff Meeting\n: The project sponsors were\nintroduced and identified.

This\nmeeting reviewed land use within the watershed and approach for\ndetention, including Leyden Lake. Follow up questions regarding the\nlake\u2019s outlet elevations resulted in survey being completed by the City\nof Arvada\u2019s surveyors.\n\n\nAugust 13, 2014 Hydrology Review / Alternative Kick-Off Meeting\n:\nComments provided by the public and project sponsors were reviewed. The\nproject team reviewed the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis\nSystem (HEC-RAS) model that will be utilized during the project. Key\nlocations within the watershed were discussed for possible alternatives.\n\n\nSeptember 24, 2014 Croke Canal Alternative Analysis:\n The project\nteam met with a representative from the Farmers Reservoir and Irrigation\nCanal Company (FRICO) to discuss alternatives for the Leyden Creek\ncrossing with the Croke Canal.\n\n\nDecember 1, 2014 Alternative Analysis Progress Meeting:\n The project\nteam discussed alternatives and evaluated which alternatives best\nmatched the project goals.\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2015 Citizen\u2019s Review Committee Meeting:\n The project\nteam met with three residents of Cameo Estates, Jennie Ridgley, Jonathan\nNelson, and Kevin Klinkerfues to discuss their comments on the DRAFT\nAlternative Analysis Report.\n\n\nFebruary 17, 2015 Public Meeting\n: A public meeting was held at Van\nArsdale Elementary School to discuss the recommended plan and gather\ncommunity input.\n\n\nSeptember 15, 2015 Conceptual Design Progress Meeting:\n The project\nteam met to discuss the comments on the DRAFT Conceptual Design Report.\n\n\n1.4 Mapping and Surveys\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGeographic Information System (GIS) layers were collected from the City\nof Arvada and Jefferson County. The layers provided included city and\ncounty boundaries, storm sewer information, zoning and parcel data.\n\n\nProject mapping was based on regional LiDAR mapping with the following\nattributes:\n\n\nGeographic Area: Colorado, Denver Metropolitan Region\n\nCoverage: Denver Metropolitan Region, approx. 947 sq. mi.\n\nCapture Date: Fall 2013 \u2013 Spring 2014\n\nCollection Resolution: 0.7 meter ground sampling distance\n\nHorizontal Datum: NAD 83\n\nVertical Datum: NAVD1988  \n\n\nA combination of aerial imagery was utilized on the project.\nEnvironmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) resource center which\nprovides 0.3 meter resolution within the continental United States was\nused along with 1 meter resolution 2012 aerial imaginary provided by\nUDFCD.\n\n\nThe City of Arvada survey staff performed a survey on the spillway for\nLeyden Lake as part of this study. Based on discussions with project\nsponsors, no other structures were surveyed; however ICON completed\nfield measurements on the Ralston Valley High School and at Lamplighter\nPark ponds.\n\n\n1.5 Data Collection\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPrevious reports for the study area were obtained from multiple sources.\nPrevious FHAD and MDP reports were obtained through UDFCD\u2019s Electronic\nData Management (EDM) system.

Leyden Creek, approximately 10.5 miles in length, ranges in\nelevation from 5420 feet at the confluence with Ralston Creek south of\n72\nnd\n Avenue and Simms Street to 7648 feet at the upstream watershed\nlimits. The watershed has an average slope of approximately 2.9%. The\nUDFCD Reuse number for the Leyden Creek watershed is 4308. The extents\nof the project area can be seen in \nFigure 2-1\n.\n\n\nDownstream of Leyden Lake, the watershed primarily consists of\nresidential development. Although the majority of the basin upstream of\nLeyden Lake is undeveloped, new development is ongoing and includes both\nresidential and industrial areas. Undeveloped open space is also\nprevalent within the Arvada city limits and within Jefferson County.\n\n\nCurrent development includes two large planned residential developments,\nboth located upstream of Leyden Lake. The Leyden Rock development is\nlocated north of W 82\nnd\n Avenue at Quaker Street extending west to the\nJefferson County landfill. Leyden Ranch West is located directly to the\neast of Leyden Rock. Based on input from project sponsors these two\ndevelopments were assumed to be fully built out since they were under\nconstruction at the time of this study. Planned development Leyden Ranch\nEast is also forthcoming; however since it is not currently under\nconstruction it was not considered built for the existing condition\nanalysis.\n\n\nThe majority of the watershed is comprised of Type C soil as defined by\nthe Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Type A, Type B, Type\nD soil are also present within the watershed. A soil map of the\nwatershed can be found in \nAPPENDIX B \u2013 Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\nAlthough there are several detention facilities in the watershed, only\nfour met criteria to be considered for flood reduction purposes in this\nstudy. Leyden Lake, providing the most storage of these facilities, is\nlocated near the center of the watershed. Upstream of Leyden Lake, a\nregional pond exists and will be formalized in the location of an\nexisting sump downstream of the Leyden Ranch West development. The other\ntwo ponds included in the study are at Ralston Valley High School and at\nLamplighter Park.\n\n\nThere are three major canals that flow through the project area,\nincluding the Church Ditch, Farmers\u2019 High Line Canal, and Croke Canal.\nAll three of these canals convey irrigation water from Clear Creek north\nto their distribution locations. Leyden Creek crosses the Church Ditch\nupstream of Leyden Lake and downstream of Quaker Street. The Farmers\u2019\nHigh Line Canal is located directly downstream of Leyden Lake. The Croke\nCanal is located downstream of Indiana Street and also upstream of the\nCameo Estates neighborhood. Canals were considered to be flowing full at\nthe time of the storm for the hydrologic analysis.\n\n\nFigure 2-1 : Vicinity Map\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n Project Bounds\n UDFCD Bounds\n\n\n2.2 Land Use\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLand use was determined by zoning data provided by project sponsors in\nGIS format and the City of Arvada\u2019s Comprehensive Land Use Plan. As\ndirected by project sponsors, the Land Use Plan was prioritized over the\nzoning information in conflicting areas.\n\n\nTo determine existing conditions, aerial imagery was used to compare to\nzoning data. When zoning data did not correlate with existing\nstructures, the zoning shapefiles were divided to better represent\nexisting conditions. This was more prevalent in Jefferson County where\nexisting development overlapped with agricultural zones. Table RO-3 of\nthe Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual (USDCM) was used to select\nimpervious values for each land use type. For residential development,\nFigures RO-3, RO-4, RO-5 (USDCM) were utilized to determine impervious\npercentages.\n\n\nTable 2-1 : Land Use Description\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand Use Description\n\n\nPercent Impervious (%)\n\n\nLand Use Description\n\n\nPercent Impervious (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndeveloped Area\n\n\n2\n\n\nResidential - 3 DU/Ac\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRailroad Tracks\n\n\n5\n\n\nSchools\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLandfill\n\n\n15\n\n\nMulti-unit - Detached\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential - 0.5 DU/Ac\n\n\n20\n\n\nMulti-unit - Attached\n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential - 1 DU/Ac\n\n\n25\n\n\nIndustrial- Light\n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential - 1.5 DU/Ac\n\n\n30\n\n\nIndustrial - Heavy\n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential - 2 DU/Ac\n\n\n35\n\n\nBusiness - Commercial Area\n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential - 3 DU/Ac\n\n\n40\n\n\nLake Water Surface\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jefferson County landfill located east of Hwy 93 and north of W.\n82\nnd\n Avenue was assigned an impervious value of 15 %. This value was\nselected after project sponsor agreement based on soil conditions\nconsistent with landfill cover and operations. This value also maintains\nconsistency with hydrology submitted for ongoing FEMA update studies.\nThe Pioneer Sand Company, located south of W. 82\nnd\n Avenue, was assumed\nto have an open space impervious value.

In general, the future\nconditions percent impervious values exceed those developed for previous\nstudies. Downstream of Leyden Lake the watershed is primarily developed,\nresulting in similar land use for both existing and future conditions.\nUpstream of the reservoir higher impervious values resulted from the\nplanned development areas and industrial locations.\n\n\nThrough discussions with project sponsors,\nthe area west of Highway 93, and south of Highway 72, zoned commercial\nand industrial in Arvada, was replaced with open space based on the land\nuse plan.

Descriptions of each reach are provided below and can be seen\non maps provided in \nAPPENDIX B \u2013 Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\nFigure 2-2 : Watershed Map\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n Project Bounds\n Arvada Limits\n UDFCD Gages\n Storage Facilities\n Blue Mountain Rd.\n\n\n Jefferson County Landfill\n Leyden Rock\n Leyden Ranch West\n\n\nDownstream of Leyden Lake a detailed floodplain analysis was conducted\nin the 2004 Boyle Flood Hazard Area Delineation study. Upstream of\nLeyden Lake an approximate detail (Zone A) floodplain exists for Leyden\nCreek and a small portion of Barbara Gulch near the confluence with\nLeyden Creek.\n\n\nReach 1- Confluence with Ralston Creek to Leyden Creek Park\n\uf0c1\n\n\n \n\n\nLeyden Creek at W 72\nnd\n Ave.\n\n\nThroughout Reach 1, Leyden Creek is bordered by residential land uses.\nThis reach of Leyden Creek is approximately 0.7 miles long and primarily\nconsists of a grass lined channel. Leyden Creek crosses Simms St. and W\n72\nnd\n Ave in this reach, passing through the Mapleleaf and Woodland\nValley subdivisions.\n\n\nReach 2- Leyden Creek Park to Upstream of Alkire Street\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nLeyden Creek at W 75\nth\n Pl.\n\n\nReach 2 stretches approximately 1 mile through residential development\nof large acre lots. The stream meanders through this reach crossing\nAlkire St. at the upstream end of the reach also crossing W 75\nth\n Pl.\nthroughout the reach. The majority of this reach is contained in the\nCameo Estates Unit 2 subdivision.\n\n\nReach 3 \u2013 Upstream of Alkire St to Leyden Lake\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nLeyden Creek upstream of Alkire St.\n\n\nReach 3, approximately 1.1 miles, contains the Indiana St. and Croke\nCanal crossings. Downstream of the crossings, the neighborhood of Cameo\nEstates lies to the north with Youth Memorial Park to the south.\n\n\nReach 4 \u2013 Upstream of Leyden Lake\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nLeyden Creek at W 82\nnd\n Ave.\n\n\nReach 4 consist primarily of a natural\nchannel on undeveloped land. The creek meanders approximately 3.3 miles\nduring this reach, starting at Highway 93 crossing W 82\nnd\n Avenue and\nQuaker St. prior to entering Leyden Lake, downstream. The Leyden Rock\nand Leyden Ranch West residential developments are currently under\nconstruction north of W. 82\nnd\n Avenue. These developments will\ncontribute flows upstream of the Leyden Creek crossing with Quaker St.\nin the Leyden Townsite subdivision.\n\n\n2.4 Flood History\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is limited information on any flooding along Leyden Creek prior to\nthe September 2013 flood event. Past hydrology studies noted severe\nflooding may have been likely, only went unrecorded. The 2009 UDFCD\nRalston Creek Flood Warning Plan also did not identify past flooding\nevents on Leyden Creek\n\n\nThere are two UDFCD stream gages located within the Leyden Creek\nwatershed. Stream Gage 203 - Leyden Reservoir Water PT was installed in\nDecember 2002 located in Leyden Lake. The maximum discharge of 1,351 cfs\nfrom this gage was recorded on September 12, 2013. Stream Gage 213 \u2013\nLeyden Confluence was installed May 1988 located east of Simms St near\nthe confluence with Ralston Creek. The record high water for this\nlocation occurred August 6, 1995 with a peak flow of 3,520 cfs. In their\n2014 report on the flooding events of Leyden Creek, Water and Earth\nTechnologies Inc. (WET) suggested Stream Gage 213 is recalibrated due to\nwhat they believed to be an overestimation of flows compared to their\nanalysis of high water marks.\n\n\nWET also reported the following regarding the September 2013 flood:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Blue Mountain Road, a plugged culvert beneath Blue Mountain Road\n    caused flows normally contributing to Coal Creek watershed to enter\n    the Leyden Creek basin. A peak flow of 280 cfs was estimated to pass\n    through the railroad embankment, eroding Blue Mountain Road where\n    the culvert was plugged. The erosion was repaired using 2,000 tons\n    of fill material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeyden Road (W. 82\nnd\n Ave) was overtopped by as much as three feet\n    at the Leyden Creek crossing. During the event the road was closed\n    between Indiana St. to Highway 93.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuaker Street was overtopped with erosion bursting a 12\u201d water main.\n    The water supply was reconfigured and there was not a sustained\n    interruption of drinking water. Peak discharges from high water\n    marks were estimated to be between the 10-yr and 50-yr levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Church Ditch embankment breached at the crossing with Leyden\n    Creek, diverting flows to Leyden Lake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outflow at Leyden Lake was recorded at 1,351 cfs much higher\n    than the previously estimated 100-yr release rate of 373 cfs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Street was overtopped prior to receiving spillway flows. The\n    roadway was ultimately inundated by up to a foot in depth.\n    Improvements were made from the existing 36- and 18-inch pipes to\n    triple (3) 36-inch CMPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Croke Canal intercepted flow from Leyden Creek when Leyden\n    overtopped the upstream canal embankment. Overtopping occurred at\n    Eldridge St. and W. 78\nth\n Place near Cameo Estates. An intentional\n    breach was made at the Leyden Creek crossing to prevent\n    breaches elsewhere. Breaching the canal resulted in a second, lower\n    flood peak on Leyden Creek impacting areas previously flooded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCameo Estates is located between Eldrige St. and Alkire St. Several\n    residences were damaged, along with flooding in pastures, yards,\n    and streets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlkire St was overtopped from W. 78\nth\n Avenue to W. 74\nth\n Drive\n    and was closed for safety reasons during the storm. There was\n    significant flood inundation within the Youth Memorial Park/Sports\n    Complex, and likely reduced downstream discharges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the flow was much higher than the expected 100-yr release rates\nat Leyden Lake, several of the reaches downstream of the lake did not\nexperience flows on that same order of magnitude. The bridge on W.\n72\nnd\n Ave was not overtopped during the flood as was the bridge at\nSimms St. These structures were originally sized for a 100-yr event.",

The Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP v1.4.3), was\nused to develop runoff hydrographs for each individual sub-watershed.\nThe hydrographs from each subwatershed were then routed using the EPA\nStormwater Management Model (SWMM), version 5.0.022 to determine\ndischarges at each design point.\n\n\nThe Leyden Creek watershed was divided into a total of 44 subwatersheds\nencompassing 11.78 square miles. After correspondence with UDFCD it was\ndetermined that the flow design points would be prioritized over\nsubwatershed size with sub-watersheds staying within the 3,000 acre\nlimits of CUHP.\n\n\nHydrologic routing generally followed the connectivity diagram presented\nin the 2003 Hydrology Report by Boyle Engineering; however the basin\nupstream of Leyden Lake was subdivided into 20 smaller basins, averaging\n294 acres in sizes; whereas the Boyle study only included two\nsub-watersheds for the same area.\n\n\nThe Blue Mountain Estates area contributed flow to the Leyden Creek\nwatershed during the September 2013 event. This area was analyzed to\ndetermine whether to include it in the watershed for this study. Through\na 2-dimentional analysis in FLO-2D, it was determined that the\ncontributing flow was more of a result from erosion during the storm\nthan surface topography. Therefore, the area was not included in the\nLeyden Creek watershed hydrology.\n\n\nFrom field review, two sub-watersheds (L303, L321) in the 2003 Boyle\nstudy were found to be non-tributary to Leyden Creek. Therefore, the\ntotal watershed area of the current study is slightly less than that\nused for past work (11.78 square miles versus 11.89 square miles).\n\n\n3.2 Design Rainfall\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOne-hour rainfall depths were derived from the USDCM Figures RA-3\nthrough RA-12 for the project area and compared with those used for past\nstudies. Generally there were minimal differences, and the past rainfall\ndepths were carried forward. 2-, 5-, and 25-year rainfall depths, not\nprovided in the previous studies, were determined from Figures RA-1,\nRA-2, and RA-4 (USDCM). Areal adjustments were not applied since only a\nminor portion of the watershed exceeded the 10 square mile threshold\nneeded for adjustment. A summary of one-hour rainfall depths can be\nfound below in Table 3-1.\n\n\nComplete rainfall distributions are provided in \nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\nTable 3-1 : 1-hr Rainfall Depths\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn Period\n\n\n1 Hour Rainfall Depth (in)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-yr\n\n\n1.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-yr\n\n\n1.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10-yr\n\n\n1.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25-yr\n\n\n2.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50-yr\n\n\n2.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100-yr\n\n\n2.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Subwatershed Characteristics\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSubwatershed characteristics are summarized in the CUHP input table and\nsubwatershed figure located in \nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\n3.3.1 Subwatershed Delineation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs discussed in Section 3.1, subwatersheds delineation focused on\nidentifying flow change locations for Leyden Creek. All basins conform\nto a maximum of 3,000 acres in size, with smaller subwatersheds located\nin more urban areas. The previous 2003 Boyle study included only 21\nsubwatersheds ranging in size from 44 acres to 3187 acres. This study\nincludes 44 subwatersheds averaging 171 acres, and ranging between 16\nacres to 1413 acres in size. Downstream of Leyden Lake the average\nwatershed size is only 69.1 acres. The Church Ditch, Farmers\u2019 High line\nCanal and Croke Canal were assumed full for the subwatershed\ndelineation.\n\n\n3.3.2 Watershed Imperviousness\n\uf0c1\n\n\nImperviousness for each subwatershed was estimated from a GIS based\ninterpretation of land use and zoning information described in\n\nSection 2.2 Land Use\n.\n\n\n3.3.3 Length, Centroid Distance, Slope\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCUHP parameters such as subwatershed length, distance to centroid, and\nslopes were derived for each subwatershed using topographic data. Slopes\nwere computed using the length-weighted, corrected average slope from\nEquation RO-9 and Figure RO-10 (USDCM). Subwatersheds downstream of\nLeyden Lake average a slope of 2.59% while the average for the entire\nwatershed is a 2.94% slope.\n\n\n3.3.4 Depression Losses\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDepression storage loss was determined based on Table RO-6 from the\nUSDCM. Aerial imagery was used to examine each subwatershed. Generally\nthe depression loss value of 0.35 for pervious areas and 0.1 for\nimpervious areas was carried forward from previous studies. A pervious\ndepression storage value of 0.4 was used upstream of Leyden Lake in open\nspace areas.\n\n\n3.3.5 Infiltration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSoil data was obtained from Natural Resources Conservation Service\n(NRCS). The majority of the basin contains Type C soil consistent with\nthe 2003 Boyle Hydrology Report. Table RO-7 provided Horton\u2019s\ninfiltration parameters for Type C/D soil which consists of an initial\ninfiltration rate of 3.0 inches per hour, a final infiltration rate of\n0.5 inches per hour and a decay coefficient of 0.0018. There are several\nbasins upstream of Leyden Lake that were found to contain Type B soil\nand parameters for these basins were adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n3.4 Hydrograph Routing\n\uf0c1\n\n\n3.4.1 Manning\u2019s n Coefficient\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach hydraulic Manning\u2019s n roughness coefficient value was selected\nusing Table MD-1 from USDCM. Following UDFCD guidance the values were\nthen increased by 25% to better represent modeling conditions.\n\n\n3.4.2 Conveyance Elements\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach conveyance element was determined by examining the contour data and\ncomparing to previous studies. Storm sewers sizes and alignments were\nmodeled based on the City of Arvada GIS files. A SWMM routing map and a\nSWMM schematic figure are included in \nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\n3.4.3 Detention Facilities\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDetention facilities within the watershed were evaluated and those\nmeeting size and public ownership requirements were included in the SWMM\nrouting. The inclusion of detention areas was reviewed with project\nsponsors. Detention was modeled at Leyden Lake, the Leyden Ranch sump,\nLamplighter Park, and at Ralston Valley High School. Storage volumes for\neach facility were determined from the project topographic mapping.\nRelease rates were developed from orifice and weir calculations\nreflecting the existing outlet structure configurations. Storage and\ndischarge curves for the four detention facilities are provided in\n\nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\nLeyden Lake was examined in further detail due to past discrepancies in\nthe spillway elevation. The City of Arvada conducted a survey to\ndetermine the elevation of the spillway in relation to the Leyden Creek\nDam As-Built drawings and project mapping. A conversion value of +2.2\nfeet was provided by Arvada to convert from the City of Arvada datum to\nthe project datum, NAVD 88. As-built elevations from the dam were\nadjusted to the project datum by adding 2.9 feet. Datum conversion\ninformation is included in \nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\n3.5 Previous Studies\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIn 1977 Wright-McLaughlin Engineers utilized the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology Catchment program (MITCAT) to develop a model for\nRalston/Leyden Creeks. The results of this MITCAT model were used to\ndevelop the effective FEMA flood insurance study (FIS).\n\n\nIn 2003 Boyle Engineering Corporation updated the hydrology for Ralston\nCreek and Leyden Lake. The purpose of the Boyle study was to update the\nwatershed model from MITCAT to CUHP/UDSWMM. The model reflected\nimprovements made to Leyden Creek Dam. Boyle examined the 10-, 50-,\n100-, and 500-year events. A FHAD downstream of Leyden Lake was also\nprepared which utilized the updated flow results.\n\n\n3.6 Hydrograph Calibration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWith input from the project sponsors, three basins (106, 115, 303)\nrequired calibration. Due to the topography of the project area, these\nbasins were underestimating runoff due to excessive length to width\nratios. The peak runoff rate coefficient, Cp, was increased for each\nbasin to produce runoff comparable to basins with similar impervious\ncharacteristics. Increases in peak flows, especially upstream of Leyden\nLake, can be attributed to the increases in imperviousness within the\nwatershed and variations in sub-watershed routing.\n\n\n3.7 Results of Analysis\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe results of the analysis are presented in \nTable 3-2\n.\nAs noted above, results compare well with past studies prepared for the UDFCD and\nadopted by FEMA. Increased discharges can be correlated with increases\nin watershed imperviousness and variations in sub-watershed routing.\n\n\nIt should also be noted that past hydrology for Leyden and Ralston\nCreeks performed rainfall adjustments for watershed areas in excess of\n10 square miles. These adjustments have not been performed with the\ncurrent update since at 11.8 square miles, the watershed is only\nmoderately above the 10 square mile threshold for rainfall adjustment.\nAdditionally, peak flows along Leyden Creek were already lower than the\neffective flows. If a similar adjustment was made, peak discharges east\nof Alkire Street would be reduced further.\n\n\nThe increase in flows from the previous study from below Leyden Lake Dam\nto Alkire Street is due to the increase in discharge from Leyden Lake.\nThe discharge increased from 373 cfs from the 2003 Boyle Hydrology\nReport to 550 cfs with the updated information. The updated survey\ninformation combined with updates to land use projections lead to an\nincrease of flows into and out of Leyden Lake.\n\n\nThe decreased flows in lower reaches are caused by updated land use and\nadded detention facilities. The update in land use data lead to a lower\nimpervious value within Reach 3. Ralston Valley High School and\nLamplighter Park detention were included with this study reducing flows\nin basins that had higher impervious values.\n\n\nPeak flow and runoff volume tables are included for both existing and\nfuture conditions for all design points, and all frequencies in\n\nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n.. Hydrographs and peak flow profiles\nare also provided in \nAPPENDIX B - Hydrologic Analysis\n.\n\n\nTable 3-2 : Previous Studies Reconciliation (100 yr.

A summary of these flood hazards is presented in\nthe Drainage Problem Areas Figure (Figure C-1) in \nAPPENDIX C -\nHydraulic Analysis\n.\n\n\n4.2.1 Flood Hazards of Reach 1\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUpstream of the confluence with Ralston Creek, to Simms Street, no\nbuildings are located within the 100-year floodplain boundary. The four\ncell, 12 feet by 5 feet reinforced concrete box culvert (RCBC) at Simms\nStreet conveys the 100-year discharges without overtopping.\n\n\nProblem Area 1A - Woodland Valley Filing No. 3\n\nDue to the overtopping of West 72\nnd\n Avenue, the 100-year floodplain is\nwidespread through the Woodland Valley Filing No. 3 subdivision.\nAlthough the residential homes are generally not inundated according to\nthe FEMA Flood Insurance Study, split flows from West 72\nnd\n Avenue\nsurround many of the buildings. The First United Church of Arvada is the\nonly building inundated from this flooding. Flood problems in this area\nrelate to adding capacity at West 72\nnd\n Avenue without worsening\nflooding potential within the Woodland Valley subdivision, as well as\nimproving flood conditions for First United Church.\n\n\nProblem Area 1B - West 72\nnd\n Avenue Bridge Crossing\n\nThe bridge roadway crossing at West 72\nnd\n Avenue has a conveyance\ncapacity less than the 10-year event. Flows in excess of the bridge\ncapacity divert water east flowing across West 72\nnd\n Avenue as\ndescribed in Problem Area 1A. The City of Arvada would like to maintain\n100-year capacity at all major crossings.\n\n\nProblem Area 1C - Woodland Valley Filing No. 7\n\nUpstream of West 72\nnd\n Avenue, eight residential homes are impacted by\nthe 100-year floodplain due to a lack of channel conveyance capacity\ndownstream of Leyden Creek Park.\n\n\n4.2.2 Flood Hazards of Reach 2\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWithin Reach 2, one residential home and two additional buildings are\nimpacted by the 100-year regulatory floodplain.\n\n\nProblem Area 2A - West 75\nth\n Place\n\nOne residential home is located within the 100-year floodplain boundary\nwithin Reach 2. The structure is located shortly downstream of West\n75\nth\n Place. The road crossing at West 75\nth\n Place is undersized 36\u201d\nCMP, with a conveyance capacity less than the 2-year discharge.\n\n\nProblem Area 2B - Cameo Estates Unit No. 2\n\nUpstream of West 75\nth\n Place, Problem Area 2C and 2D lead to the Zone X\nShaded shallow flooding seen in Cameo Estates Unit No. 2. The shallow\nflooding flows spilling over Alkire impact several residential\nbuildings, although these structures are not within the regulatory\n100-year floodplain boundary. There are two structures within the\nregulatory floodplain between Alkire Street and West 75\nth\n Place.\n\n\nProblem Area 2C - Alkire Street Culvert Crossing\n\nAlkire Street is overtopped for the 2-year and larger discharges. As\nshown by past studies, and as part of the 2013 flood, the low point in\nAlkire Street does not occur at the culvert location, but approximately\n600 feet south of the culvert. Flooding from the low point in this area\nresults in widespread shallow flows across Alkire Street to the east,\nwithin the Cameo Estates Unit No. 2 subdivision. The City of Arvada\nwishes to manage a higher level of capacity for the crossing at this\nlocation to reduce flooding potential downstream.\n\n\nProblem Area 2D - Upstream of Alkire Street\n\nUpstream of Alkire Street, Leyden Creek spills out of its right bank\nacross the Youth Memorial Sports Complex entrance road diverting flows\nsouth spilling over Alkire Street. Any flows that are diverted as part\nof Problem Area 2D contribute to the flood hazards mentioned in Problem\nArea 2C.\n\n\n4.2.3 Flood Hazards of Reach 3\n\uf0c1\n\n\nProblem areas within this reach relate to the impacts of private ponds\nin the floodplain areas in addition to the buildings and residences\nlocated within the floodplain. A total of three structures, two\nresidential homes are inundated by the 100-year floodplain within Reach\n3.\n\n\nProblem Area 3A - Cameo Estates\n\nAlthough not impacted by the 100-year regulatory floodplain, many homes\nnear this area were impacted by the flooding in September 2013. Flooding\nwas determined to be related to diversion from Leyden Creek near ponds,\nfence lines, and other obstructions, as well as overflows from the canal\nsystems located in proximity to Cameo Estates. This area was also\ndetermined to be subject to flooding potential for events exceeding the\n100-year event, such as the September 2013 flood.\n\n\nProblem Area 3B - West of Cameo Estates\n\nUpstream of Cameo Estates, private ponds, fence lines, and other\nobstructions have potential to divert flows towards residential\ndevelopment, away from the natural flow paths. This was evident in\nSeptember 2013.\n\n\nProblem Area 3C - Croke Canal\n\nThe 36\u201d CMP crossing of Leyden Creek under the Croke Canal is undersized\nleading to flows spilling into the Croke Canal. These comingled flows\nexceed the design capacity of the canal, jeopardizing the structural\nintegrity of the canal. This was experienced with the September 2013\nflooding where the canal bank eroded and eventually breached near West\n78\nth\n Place and Eldridge Street.\n\n\nProblem Area 3D - Indiana Street\n\nEven though it was improved since the 2013 flood, the crossing at\nIndiana Street still remains undersized compared to the 100-year event.\nUpstream of Indiana Street there are two residential homes inundated by\nthe 100-year floodplain.\n\n\n4.2.4 Flood Hazards of Reach 4\n\uf0c1\n\n\nProblem Area 4A - Leyden Lake\n\nAs demonstrated by the updated hydrology in this report, Leyden Lake\novertops during the 100-year and more significant events even though the\noriginal design of this facility was intended to provide 100-year level\nof protection. Flows that are discharged over the Leyden Lake spillway\nmay be intercepted by the Farmers\u2019 High Line Canal and can lead to other\npotential damages.\n\n\nProblem Area 4B - Church Ditch\n\nThe Leyden Creek crossing with the Church Ditch lacks capacity to convey\nthe flow without overtopping the canal. The canal embankment was eroded\nduring the September 2013 flood due to the lack of capacity. This\nultimately diverted flows from the Church Ditch into Leyden Lake. No\nstructures are present in the vicinity of the Church Ditch crossing.\n\n\nProblem Area 4C - Quaker Street\n\nThe existing crossing at Quaker Street has less than a 2-year capacity,\ncausing excess flows to overtop the road. This lack of conveyance\ncapacity also contributes to the flooding associated with Problem Area\n4D.\n\n\nProblem Area 4D - Leyden Townsite\n\nUpstream of the Quaker Street crossing, within the Leyden Townsite\nsubdivision, four structures are at risk within the 100-yr regulatory\nfloodplain, including two homes. The source of the flood hazards in the\narea are due to the lack of channel conveyance capacity and the\novertopping at Quaker Street.\n\n\nProblem Area 4E - Pattridge Open Space\n\nThrough Pattridge Open Space, steep longitudinal slopes have led to high\nvelocities, causing erosion of the banks of Leyden Creek. As further\ndevelopment occurs upstream and flows increase, grade control is\nwarranted to address future degradation.\n\n\nProblem Area 4F - West 82\nnd\n Avenue\n \nThe culvert crossing at West 82\nnd\n Avenue currently has less than a\n5-year capacity. The City of Arvada would like to maintain 100-year\nconveyance capacity for all major roadway crossings.\n\n\nProblem Area 4G - Blue Mountain Estates\n\nDuring the September 2013 flood, flows from the Blue Mountain Estates\narea eroded the shoulders of Blue Mountain Road and diverted water into\nthe Leyden Creek watershed. Not only did this require repair from the\nCity of Arvada, but it also limited access to Blue Mountain Estates\nduring the flood. The City of Arvada wishes to maintain a higher level\nof capacity for Blue Mountain Road and reduce the potential for future\ndamages in the area, as seen in the Drainage Problem Area Figures in\n\nAPPENDIX C - Hydraulic Analysis\n.\n\n\n4.3 Previous Analysis\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPrevious analysis of the Leyden Creek watershed consists of the\nRalston/Leyden Creek Major Drainageway Planning by Wright-McLaughlin in\n1977 and the Flood Hazard Delineation Ralston Creek - Leyden Creek in\n2004 by Boyle Engineering. The 1977 MDP identified the road crossings\nthroughout the watershed to be improved from West 82\nnd\n Avenue (Leyden\nRoad in 1977 MDP) to Simms Street. The 2004 FHAD identified the Alkire\nStreet crossing as \u201cinadequately sized to convey more than nuisance\nflows and results in overtopping of the street and shallow flooding to\nthe east of Alkire Street during larger events.\u201d The water surface\nelevations downstream of the Leyden Lake to W 75\nth\n Place have increase\ndue to increased discharges from the dam due to inaccurate elevations\nused in the rating curve in previous studies.",

The easements needed to implement the 100-yr\nConveyance Alternative are not feasible given the residential lots in\nthis area.\n\n\nThe channel grading in the Woodland Valley No. 7 subdivision associated\nwith the 100-yr Conveyance Plan is included in the recommended plan. The\nresidential buildings currently in the regulatory 100-year floodplain\ncan be removed by the proposed project.\n\n\n6.1.2 Reach 2 Recommended Plan\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Plan is recommended for\nReach 2. While the other two alternative plans remove additional\nbuildings from the floodplain, the additional benefits associated with\nthose alternatives do not justify the added cost. The Minimum Crossing\nImprovement Plan will address the Zone X shaded flood hazard area by\npreventing the spill flows that creates the shallow flooding at Alkire\nStreet. This alternative will not have any impact on the proposed Ward\nRoad expansion trail or roadway crossing at Leyden Creek.\n\n\n6.1.3 Reach 3 Recommended Plan\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe recommended plan for Reach 3 includes the 100-yr Conveyance Plan\ncrossing structure at Indiana Street and the Croke Canal, but does not\ninclude the overflow channel west of Cameo Estates. The overflow channel\nwas not included as it would not directly mitigate any flood hazards.\n\n\nAt the Croke Canal, the proposed improvement will convey the 100-yr\ndischarge underneath the canal, minimizing the comingling flows,\neliminating the need for the passive weir structure. During final\ndesign, an additional flood control purge structure should be\ninvestigated to determine the feasibility between the City of Arvada and\nthe Croke Canal representatives.\n\n\n6.1.4 Reach 4 Recommended Plan\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNo improvements are recommended at Leyden Lake. Improving Leyden Lake to\ncontain the 100-yr design storm only impacts a short reach of Leyden\nCreek immediately downstream of the spillway. The first roadway crossing\nat Indiana Street is not affected in size if any improvements to Leyden\nCreek are proposed. Although no roadway crossings would be impacted, the\nFarmers\u2019 High Line Canal would be impacted. Any flows that are\ndischarged over the emergency spillway are intercepted by the Farmers\u2019\nHigh Line Canal. Flows through the primary spillway do not influence the\nFarmers\u2019 High Line Canal.\n\n\nThe Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Plan is recommended\nplan for Quaker Street. The benefit cost analysis determined the\nadditional work associated with channelization of Leyden Creek through\nthis stretch was not equivalent to the additional cost. Any trail\ncrossing near Quaker Street will be further evaluated during Conceptual\nDesign.\n\n\nThe Minimum Crossing Improvement and Maintenance Alternative is also\nrecommended at West 82\nnd\n Avenue. The additional benefit of the\n100-year Conveyance alternative is removing the trailhead from the\nfloodplain. Since it is not feasible to assume the trailhead would be\nheavily used during the 100-year event, removing the trailhead from the\nfloodplain is not a priority.\n\n\nBlue Mountain Road is only access road for Blue Mountain Estates,\ncreating the need to provide access during the 100-year event. After\ncomparing the cost associated with each alternative, the Minimum\nCrossing Improvement and Maintenance Plan was selected for Blue Mountain\nEstates. This plan eliminates roadway overtopping at Blue Mountain\nEstates, and the grouted boulder structure will ensure the majority of\nthe discharge overtopping the railroad will remain tributary to the\nhistoric flow path in the Coal Creek Watershed.\n\n\nThe final design of elevating Blue Mountain Road should investigate any\nimpacts to the structures downstream of Blue Mountain Road.\n\n\nTable 6-1 : Recommended Cost Estimate Summary\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReach\n\n\nSelected Plan\n\n\nCapital\n\n\nEasement/ROW\n\n\nEng/Admin/Legal\n\n\nContingency\n\n\nTotal Capital Cost\n\n\n50-year O&M Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReach 1\n\n\nMinimum Crossing and Maintenance\n\n\n$2,686,870\n\n\n$24,288\n\n\n$806,062\n\n\n$671,718\n\n\n$4,188,938\n\n\n$29,925\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReach 2\n\n\nMinimum Crossing and Maintenance\n\n\n$920,731\n\n\n$59,698\n\n\n$276,218\n\n\n$230,183\n\n\n$1,486,830\n\n\n$27,300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReach 3\n\n\n100-yr Conveyance\n\n\n$1,134,068\n\n\n$17,884\n\n\n$340,220\n\n\n$283,517\n\n\n$1,775,689\n\n\n$0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReach 4\n\n\nMinimum Crossing and Maintenance\n\n\n$7,109,199\n\n\n$353,731\n\n\n$2,132,760\n\n\n$1,777,300\n\n\n$11,372,990\n\n\n$128,764\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Cost\n\n\n$11,850,868\n\n\n$455,601\n\n\n$3,555,260\n\n\n$2,962,718\n\n\n$18,824,447\n\n\n$185,989\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6-2 : Jurisdictional Cost Estimate Summary\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurisdiction\n\n\nCapital\n\n\nEasement/ROW\n\n\nEng/Admin/Legal\n\n\nContingency\n\n\nTotal Capital Cost\n\n\n50-year O&M Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity of Arvada\n\n\n$7,964,835\n\n\n$266,812\n\n\n$2,389,452\n\n\n$1,991,210\n\n\n$12,612,309\n\n\n$131,319\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJefferson County\n\n\n$1,611,792\n\n\n$85,562\n\n\n$483,536\n\n\n$402,948\n\n\n$2,583,838\n\n\n$58,065\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoA / Jeff Co\n\n\n$2,470,136\n\n\n$118,980\n\n\n$741,040\n\n\n$617,534\n\n\n$3,947,690\n\n\n$41,125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Water Quality Impacts\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is no regional water quality improvements proposed for the Leyden\nCreek watershed. New developments, such as Leyden Rock, and Leyden Ranch\nWest, will handle water quality on a site specific basis.\n\n\nEroding channel banks also can lead to degradation in water quality\nthroughout a watershed. By implementing the proposed stable channel\nslopes, less erosion will occur, improving the water quality in the\nwatershed.\n\n\n6.3 Operations and Maintenance\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCulvert maintenance for all proposed improvements was assumed to occur\nonce every two years. Channel maintenance for proposed improved\nchannels, and all proposed hydraulic structures was assumed to be\nperformed once every five years.\n\n\n6.4 Environmental and Safety Assessment\n\uf0c1\n\n\nImplementation of the recommended plan will reduce flood hazards at\nselected roadway crossings. These changes will also improve emergency\naccess during flood events. With exception to at 75\nth\n Place, culvert\ncapacity up to the 100-year event has been provided.\n\n\nERO assessed the study area for potential wetlands and waters of the\nU.S., threatened and endangered species, and general wildlife use. Below\nis a summary of the resources found at the study area and\nrecommendations or future actions necessary based on the current site\nconditions and federal, state, and local regulations. ERO\u2019s entire\nassessment can be found in \nAPPENDIX E - Wetland and Riparian\nInventory (PDF version only)\n.\n\n\n6.4.1 General\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlthough there are some regulated resources in the study area, none of\nthem are unique or regionally important. Aside from potential depletions\nassociated with new water bodies, ERO has not identified any significant\nregulatory constraints on the proposed projects.

The additional benefit of the\n100-year Conveyance alternative is removing the trailhead from the\nfloodplain. Since it is not feasible to assume the trailhead would be\nheavily used during the 100-year event, removing the trailhead from the\nfloodplain is not a priority.  Blue Mountain Road is only access road for Blue Mountain Estates,\ncreating the need to provide access during the 100-year event. After\ncomparing the cost associated with each alternative, the Minimum\nCrossing Improvement and Maintenance Plan was selected for Blue Mountain\nEstates. This plan eliminates roadway overtopping at Blue Mountain\nEstates, and the grouted boulder structure will ensure the majority of\nthe discharge overtopping the railroad will remain tributary to the\nhistoric flow path in the Coal Creek Watershed.  The final design of elevating Blue Mountain Road should investigate any\nimpacts to the structures downstream of Blue Mountain Road.",

The\nSelected plan identifies the alternatives selected by the project\nsponsors to proceed into the Conceptual Design phase of the project. The\nSelected Plan generally followed the recommended plan alternatives, with\nthe modification of choosing the 100-year Conveyance Alternative for\nReach 1, between West 72nd Avenue and Simms Street. Incorporation of\npedestrian trails were evaluated at Quaker Street and West 72\nnd\n Avenue\nin the conceptual design phase.\n\n\nThe master plan improvements are intended to mitigate flooding, and\nprevent erosion along Leyden Creek. Roadway crossings and the crossing\nwith the Croke Canal are intended to convey the 100-year future\nconditions discharges. An exception is at West 75th Place, which will\nconvey the 10-year discharge in accordance with Jefferson County\nCriteria. Future erosion potential will be managed implementing check\nstructures. Mitigation of the 100-year floodplain within the Woodland\nValley No. 7 subdivision is proposed through the implementation of\nadjacent channel improvements. Finally, the master plan improvements\nincorporate trail connections to the regional trail networks, where\napplicable.\n\n\n7.1.1 General Recommendations\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLand-use changes to contributing watersheds affect the flood hazard\nnature (i.e., runoff rates, volumes and depths), the transport of\nsediment, and the water quality of the receiving natural waterways. To\nencourage the implementation of this master plan, it is recommended:\n\n\n\n\nThat the controlling jurisdictions take steps to stabilize all major\n    waterways when their watershed urbanizes, rehabilitate existing\n    degraded reaches of the waterways and their tributaries, and\n    aggressively control erosion and sediment transport during\n    construction activities.\n\n\nThat Sponsors and any other jurisdiction having land use control\n    powers in this watershed require new land development and\n    significant redevelopment and publicly funded projects to provide to\n    the maximum extent practicable runoff volume control practices\n    (i.e., minimize directly connected impervious areas and employ\n    infiltrating BMPs) whenever site conditions permit.\n\n\nThat the controlling jurisdictions take steps to require that all\n    BMPs for all new development, redevelopment, and publicly funded\n    projects provide to the maximum extent practicable a Water Quality\n    Capture Volume (WQCV) as recommended in the Urban Storm Drainage\n    Criteria Manual - Volume 3, after accounting for volume reductions\n    achieved using volume control practices as recommended under item\n    b above.\n\n\nThat all jurisdiction having land use control powers in this\n    watershed continue to implement their floodplain management\n    regulations, including regulation of the 100-year floodway\n    and floodplain.\n\n\nIf not already done so, all jurisdictions should adopt a policy of\n    preserving the defined floodplains as open spaces to the maximum\n    extent possible and that at least 1-foot freeboard be provided for\n    the lowest floor above the 100-year flood elevation shown on the\n    latest flood hazard area delineation of FIRM maps for all human\n    occupied structures built adjacent to, or within, the defined\n    100-year floodplains.\n\n\nThat all jurisdiction having land use control powers in this\n    watershed continue to participate in FEMA\u2019s flood insurance\n    Community Rating System and public education programs.\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Conceptual Design Cost Estimates\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCost estimates for the conceptual design were developed using UDFCD\u2019s\nmaster planning cost estimating spreadsheet UD-MP COST, version 2.2. The\nColorado Construction Index was updated to the First Quarter 2015 value\nof 1.0703. Utility relocation estimates were determined from information\nprovided by the City of Arvada, Century Link, and XCEL Energy. The City\nof Arvada provided sanitary sewer information with approximate depths\nand the location and sizing of the water mains. Century Link and XCEL\nEnergy provided approximate utility locates at each street crossing.\n\n\nEasement costs were calculated from the easement area required for each\nof the property and the actual land value provided by Jefferson County.\n\n\n7.2 Master Plan Description\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Conceptual Design is described on a reach by reach basis in Sections\n7.2.1 through 7.2.4. Cost Estimates for the Selected Plan can be found\nin \nTable 7-5: Cost Estimate Summary by Reach\n. Schematics for the\nSelected Plan can be found in \nFigure 7-1\n. Master Plan maps and\nprofiles can be found in \nAPPENDIX H\n.\n\n\nDownstream of Leyden Lake a design slope of 0.45% was selected for\nstabilization of the main channel. Upstream of the Leyden Lake, a design\nslope of 0.60% was selected. These values were chosen to in accordance\nof UDFCD criteria, previous master plans, and discussion with the\nproject sponsors.\n\n\nIn general, toe protection along Leyden Creek is proposed to allow for a\nfree meander of the low flow channel bottom, except in areas in close\nproximity to existing or proposed infrastructure. Bio-engineered methods\nand riparian vegetation is encouraged to be used as an alternate to\nriprap.\n\n\nTwo feet of cover above new storm sewers was assumed for all roadway\ncrossings. Whenever possible, two feet of clearance between the top of\nsanitary sewers and the bottom of culverts was proposed. When this\nclearance was not feasible due to the size of the required crossing\nstructure, one foot of clearance was provided along with a concrete\nencasement for the sanitary sewer. All other utilities were assumed to\nbe relocated, if required.\n\n\nGrade control was established through a combination of sloping drop\nstructure, check structures and riffle drop structures. Check structures\nwere used in areas which may experience future channel degradation. Drop\nstructures were selected along proposed channels alignments and areas\nwith significant grade changes between existing and proposed channel\nconfigurations. When the grade changes were less than 2-feet in height,\nriffle type drop structures were recommended.\n\n\n7.2.1 Reach 1 - Confluence with Ralston Creek to Leyden Creek Park Selected Plan\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe selected plan for Reach 1 recommends improving the bridge at West\n72\nnd\n Avenue and increasing the conveyance capacity of the channel\ndownstream. A 10 foot concrete pedestrian trail was also included from\nSimms Street through West 72\nnd\n Avenue along with a proposed pedestrian\nunderpass with eight feet of clearance. This underpass will connect to\nthe existing trail at Leyden Creek Park. Two sloping boulder drop\nstructures upstream of West 72\nnd\n Avenue lower the channel invert to\nallow adequate clearance for the trail underpass. A 110 ft. span bridge\nat West 72\nnd\n Avenue has been proposed to convey the 100-year discharge\nof 2,083 cfs. Double stacked boulder walls have been proposed on both\nsides of the channel to minimize the required easements on private\nproperty. The boulder wall transitions to standard side slopes before\ntying into existing channel just upstream of Simms Street. The existing\ndrop structure just upstream of Simms Street is proposed to be removed\nto accommodate the improvements.\n\n\nThis project would remove the only structure in the 100-yr floodplain\ndownstream of West 72\nnd\n Avenue, the First Church of Arvada. All\nresidential structures in the Woodland Valley No. 3 subdivision would\nalso be removed from the Zone X Shallow Flooding Hazard Area.\n\n\nUpstream of West 72\nnd\n Avenue, in Leyden Creek Park, the channel is\nproposed to be lowered to remove the regulatory floodplain from the\nhomes in the Woodland Valley No. 7 subdivision. A riffle drop structure\nis proposed to transition the channel back to existing grades at the\nupstream end of improvements. Approximately 530 feet of pedestrian path\nwill need to be relocated with the proposed channel project.\n\n\nThe eight homes currently within the 100-year floodplain would all be\nremoved by this project.\n\n\nThere are several known utilities in this project reach. These utilities\nwill need to be protected, or relocated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWATER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 inch AC crossing proposed channel upstream of Simms Street\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 inch STL at West 72\nnd\n

- Leyden Creek Park to Upstream of Alkire Street Selected Plan\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAn extension of Ward Road from West 72\nnd\n Avenue north to the existing\nalignment was in development at the time of this master plan. 30%\nconceptual design plans were provided by the City of Arvada for\nincorporation into this report. The roadway expansion will include a\nstream crossing downstream of West 75\nth\n Place as well as two\npedestrian trail underpasses.\n\n\nTwin 9 ft. x 4 ft. RCBC\u2019s are proposed to convey the 10-year discharge\nof 520 cfs below West 75\nth\n Place to meet Jefferson County Criteria.\nLess than 1 foot of depth of overtopping occurs during the 100-year\nevent. A concrete encasement of the sanitary sewer will also be required\nto accommodate the proposed culvert and allow two feet of roadway cover.\nA drop structure transition upstream of the road is also required. This\nproject will not have a significant impact on the floodplain and will\nnot remove the home downstream of West 75\nth\n Place from the floodplain.\n\n\nTo mitigate the roadway overtopping and shallow flooding that impacts\nproperty to the east of Alkire Street, new box culverts have been\nproposed. Four 12 ft. x 4 ft. RCBC\u2019s are required to convey the 100-year\ndischarge without overtopping the low point in Alkire Street. Headwater\ndepth at this location is limited by the sanitary crossing located east\nof the stream crossing. This project will require that the existing pond\nfeatures, upstream of Alkire Street, be adjusted and lowered\naccordingly. A 4 foot sloping drop structure is proposed to transition\nback into existing grades along the channel.\n\n\nThere are two existing structures in the floodplain downstream of the\nproposed project limits east of Alkire Street. Although these\nimprovements will not remove these structures from the 100-yr\nfloodplain, this project would alleviate the overtopping at Alkire\nStreet, removing eleven structures including six residential homes from\nthe shallow flooding hazard area.\n\n\nSeveral check structures proposed within Reach 2 will stabilize the\nchannel slope preventing future channel degradation\n\n\nThe only known utility at West 75\nth\n Place is the sanitary sewer at an\napproximate depth of 8 feet.\n\n\nAt Alkire Street there are several known utilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWATER\n\n\n\n\n18\u201d PVC at Alkire Street\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEWER\n\n\n\n\n12\u201d PVC at Alkire Street, Depth approximately 9.5 feet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentury Link\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXcel Electric\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXcel Gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReach 2 Map\n\n\nReach 2 Profile\n\n\nTable 7-2 : Reach 2 Cost Estimate Summary\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nDescription\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \nQuantity\n\n    \nUnit\n\n    \nUnit Cost\n\n    \nTotal Cost\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nConcrete\u00a0Box Culverts\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nBox Culvert Pipe\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nIndividual\u00a0Box Span (ft)\n\n    \nBox Height (ft)\n\n    \nNo. of Barrels\n\n    \nLength (ft)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n9\n\n    \n4\n\n    \n2\n\n    \n54\n\n    \nL.F.\n\n    \n$1,524.02\n\n    \n$82,297.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n12\n\n    \n4\n\n    \n4\n\n    \n50\n\n    \nL.F.\n\n    \n$3,673.69\n\n    \n$183,684.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nHeadwall and Toewalls\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nIndividual\u00a0Box Span (ft)\n\n    \nNo. of Barrels\n\n    \nTotal Span (ft)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n9\n\n    \n2\n\n    \n21.00\n\n    \n2\n\n    \nEA\n\n    \n$1,618.47\n\n    \n$3,237.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n12\n\n    \n4\n\n    \n52.00\n\n    \n2\n\n    \nEA\n\n    \n$4,272.84\n\n    \n$8,546.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nWingwalls\u00a0(includes wingwalls on either side of channel and concrete apron)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nIndividual\u00a0Box Span (ft)\n\n    \nBox Rise (ft)\n\n    \nNo. of Barrels\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n9\n\n    \n4\n\n    \n2\n\n    \n2\n\n    \nEA\n\n    \n$9,214.00\n\n    \n$18,428.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n12\n\n    \n4\n\n    \n4\n\n    \n2\n\n    \nEA\n\n    \n$15,287.41\n\n    \n$30,574.80\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nHydraulic Structures\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nSloping Drop Structures\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nHeight (ft)\n\n    \nBottom Width (ft)\n\n    \nYn (ft)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n4\n\n    \n40\n\n    \n5\n\n    \n1\n\n    \nEA\n\n    \n$116,149.82\n\n    \n$116,150.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nCheck Structures\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nCheck\u00a0Structure, Concrete\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n210\n\n    \nL.F.\n\n    \n$289.00\n\n    \n$60,690.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nChannel Improvements\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nSoil\u00a0Riprap, Type M\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n395\n\n    \nC.Y.\n\n    \n$75.00\n\n    \n$29,625.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nExcavation,\u00a0Mid Range\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n1432\n\n    \nC.Y.\n\n    \n$26.00\n\n    \n$37,232.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nExcavation,\u00a0Mid Range\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n7000\n\n    \nC.Y.\n\n    \n$26.00\n\n    \n$182,000.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nSoil\u00a0Riprap, Type M\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n580\n\n    \nC.Y.\n\n    \n$75.00\n\n    \n$43,500.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nRemovals\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nRemoval\u00a0of culvert pipe (D<48\")\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n54\n\n    \nL.F.\n\n    \n$21.00\n\n    \n$1,134.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nRemoval of\u00a0culvert pipe (48\"<D<84\")\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n50\n\n    \nL.F.\n\n    \n$54.00\n\n    \n$2,700.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nSpecial Items (User Defined)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nAsphalt\u00a0Remove and Replace-Alkire\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n270\n\n    \nS.Y.\n\n    \n$60.00\n\n    \n$16,200.00\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n2 ft.

Although the\nflood flows generally exceed that of the 100-year level, a project has\nbeen proposed to help mitigate future hazards. Mitigation in this area\nincludes re-grading of the pond bank east of Cameo Estates which will\nhelp keep flows within Leyden Creek and prevent overflows from spilling\ntowards the Cameo Estates subdivision. Costs have been included for the\npond embankment, and a new pond outlet structure. An easement cost has\nbeen included since the pond is located on private property and will\nrequire coordination with the project owner.\n\n\nDownstream of the Croke Canal presents an opportunity for wetland\nmitigation. The wetlands south of Leyden Creek should be maintained and\nimproved during final design. A maintenance trail is included which\nshould be incorporated into any pedestrian trail expansion in the area.\n\n\nAt the Croke Canal a triple cell 10 ft. x 3 ft. RCBC will convey the\n100-year discharges underneath the canal eliminating the need for the\nexisting siphon and prevent any comingling of flows between the canal\nand Leyden Creek. The downstream bank of the canal will also be\nreinforced, with a defined spillway to protect the canal in the event\nthat overtopping occurs. The spillway was designed at the existing\novertopping elevation ensuring only flows in excess of the canal\ncapacity are discharged over the spillway. Feasibility of including a\npurge structure to reduce flows in the canal at this location should be\ninvestigated in the future between representatives from the Croke Canal\nand City of Arvada; however this purge structure has not been included\nin this plan, at this time.\n\n\nSimilarly, at Indiana Street a 10 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC is proposed to convey\nthe 100-year discharge below the roadway. Several drop structures are\nneeded throughout this reach to achieve the grade needed to eliminate\nthe siphon flow under the Croke Canal. The only two structures within\nthe 100-year floodplain would be removed by the implementation of this\nproject.\n\n\nThere are several known utilities in the project

Lake\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo incorporate the future pedestrian trail, a 180 ft. span bridge is\nproposed at Quaker Street. A 10 foot concrete pedestrian trail with 10\nfeet of clearance will provide access to the south along Quaker Street\nfor future trailhead and pedestrian bridge east of Quaker Street. Two\nsloping drop structures are proposed upstream of Quaker Street to allow\nadequate roadway cover. This plan follows the current alignment of\nQuaker Street. Future changes to Quaker Street should be considered with\nfinal design of the improvements. There are four structures in the\n100-year floodplain. The new channel and bridge will remove two of the\nstructures from the floodplain, while the other two structures area\nlocated upstream of the proposed project and would remain in the 100-yr\nfloodplain.\n\n\nThroughout Pattridge Open Space, check structures have been proposed to\nstabilize the channel slope and prevent future degradation and erosion.\n\n\nAt West 82\nnd\n Avenue a five cell 10 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC crossing structure\nhas been proposed to convey the 100-year discharge below the roadway.\nSloping drop structures are required for roadway cover to transition\nbetween the existing and proposed channel elevations and to provide\ncover at the roadway. During final design spreading out the culverts\nalong West 82\nnd\n Avenue should be investigated to minimize grade change\nin the Pattridge Open Space area.\n\n\nUpstream, at Blue Mountain Road, the existing crossing structure is\nproposed to be replaced with an 8 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC. Approximately 1300\nfeet of Blue Mountain Road is also proposed to also be reconstructed to\ngain adequate roadway cover over the proposed culverts and to prevent\novertopping back into the Leyden Creek Watershed. A double stacked 48\u201d\ngrouted boulder wall will prevent flows overtopping the railroad from\ncontributing to the Leyden Creek watershed. These flows will be conveyed\nunder Blue Mountain Road through a second 8 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC east of the\nstream crossing. The final design of elevating Blue Mountain Road should\ninvestigate any impacts to the homes and property downstream of Blue\nMountain Road.\n\n\nThe known utilities in Reach 4 include:\n\n\nQuaker

Schematic\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Prioritization and Phasing\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIn general, drainage improvements should be constructed from downstream\nto upstream to avoid any adverse impacts. Due to the isolated nature of\neach alternative in the master plan, no adverse impacts would be\nexpected from implementing the proposed projects separately. A\ndiscussion on prioritization from an engineering perspective is\npresented below.\n\n\nPriority 1 - Public Safety:\n\nFrom a public health and safety\nstandpoint the alternative with the highest priority of implementation\nwould be at Indiana Street and the Croke Canal crossing. This area was\nseverely impacted during the September 2013 event and required breaching\nof the Croke Canal to prevent further damages downstream. An\nuncontrolled breach of the canal could result in flood damages through\nthe Cameo Estates, and nearby neighborhoods. The implementation of this\nproject separates Leyden Creek 100-year discharges from the canal,\nfurther protecting the Canal\u2019s integrity during flood events. A\nformalized spill location has also been proposed to manage spill flows\nin excess of the canal capacity.\n\n\nPriority 2 - Emergency Access:\n\nImprovements at West 82\nnd\n Avenue are\nrecommended next to improve localized access during storm events. During\nthe September 2013 flood this roadway was severely overtopping,\neliminating the possibility of vehicular use. Blue Mountain Road\npresents similar access concerns as West 82\nnd\n Avenue as it serves as\nthe primary access for residents in the area. By implementing roadway\nand culvert improvements, residents will have improved access during\nmajor storm events. Improvements at Blue Mountain Road will also reduce\ntrans basin inflows to the Leyden Creek watershed.\n\n\nPriority 3 - Floodplain Reduction:\n\nSeveral structures are located\nwithin a shallow, 100-year, flood hazard area east of Alkire Street.\nImprovements at Alkire would convey flow underneath the roadway and\nreduce flood risk within these shallow flooding zones. Similarly,\nimproving the channel near Woodland Valley No. 7, upstream of West\n72\nnd\n Avenue would also remove the eight homes from the 100-year\nfloodplain. This improvement requires a minimal level of easement\nacquisition to implement the improvements.\n\n\nPriority 4 - Minimum Flood Improvements:\n\nWhile the West 75\nth\n Place\nproject would not have significant impact on reducing 100-year\nfloodplain limits, this project would reduce the frequent flooding of\nthe roadway crossing.\u00a0 The project would convey all discharges up to the\n10-year event, whereas the existing crossing structure does not have the\ncapacity to convey the 2-year event.\n\n\nPriority 5 - Future Roadway and Trail Needs:\n\nAlthough projects at\nWest 72\nnd\n Avenue to Simms Street and at Quaker Street will remove\nseveral properties from the floodplain, each of these projects will\nrequire significant easements from private properties to implement the\nimprovements. For these reasons, is it recommended that these two\nprojects be implemented alongside, or ahead of, other City needs\nincluding roadway expansion projects or extensions of the regional trail\nnetwork.\n\n\n7.4 Water Quality Impacts\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNo regional water quality improvements are proposed for the Leyden Creek\nwatershed. New developments, such as Leyden Rock, and Leyden Ranch West,\nwill manage water quality on a site specific basis.\n\n\nEroding channel banks also can lead to degradation in water quality\nthroughout a watershed. By implementing the proposed stable channel\nslopes and stabilization structures, erosion will be less prominent,\nimproving overall water quality along Leyden Creek.\n\n\n7.5 Operations and Maintenance\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCulvert maintenance for all proposed improvements was assumed to occur\nonce every two years. Channel and all proposed hydraulic structures\nmaintenance was assumed to be performed once every five years.\nMaintenance would include routine mowing of grass lined channels, debris\nremoval, and sediment removal\n\n\n7.6 Environmental and Safety Assessment\n\uf0c1\n\n\nImplementation of the recommended plan will reduce flood hazards at\nselected roadway crossings. These changes will also improve emergency\naccess during flood events. With exception to at 75\nth\n Place, culvert\ncapacity up to the 100-year event has been provided.\n\n\nERO assessed the study area for potential wetlands and waters of the\nU.S., threatened and endangered species, and general wildlife use. Below\nis a summary of the resources found at the study area and\nrecommendations or future actions necessary based on the current site\nconditions and federal, state, and local regulations. ERO\u2019s entire\nassessment can be found in \nAPPENDIX E - Wetland and Riparian\nInventory (PDF version only)\n.\n\n\n7.6.1 General\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAlthough there are some regulated resources in the study area, none of\nthem are unique or regionally important. Aside from potential depletions\nassociated with new water bodies, ERO has not identified any significant\nregulatory constraints on the proposed projects. Because of their\ndynamic natures, site conditions and regulations should be reconfirmed\nby a qualified consultant prior to conducting construction activities\nwithin the watershed.\n\n\n7.6.2 Wetlands and Other Waters of the U.S.\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLeyden Creek, most of its tributaries, and abutting wetlands are likely\nwaters of the U.S. Any activity in the proposed alternatives that would\nrequire placing dredged or fill material into Leyden Creek, tributaries,\nor wetlands must comply with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Many of\nthe activities in the proposed alternatives would provide a net benefit\nto the stream, particularly reestablishing open reaches and grading the\nchannel.\n\n\n7.6.3 Threatened and Endangered Species\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is no suitable habitat present for any listed threatened or\nendangered species, but depletions associated with new water bodies\nwould likely require consultation on potential depletions associated\nwith the water bodies and their potential effects on downstream\nthreatened and endangered species on the Platte River in Nebraska. If\nconstruction activities are likely to take place outside of the Preble\u2019s\nDenver metro block clearance zone, it is recommended that a threatened\nand endangered species letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service be\nsubmitted.\n\n\n7.6.4 Migratory Birds and Other Wildlife\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf any active nests are found in the study area, any work that would\ndestroy the nests should not be conducted until the birds have abandoned\nthe nests. If possible, ground-clearing activities should occur outside\nof the April 1 through August 31 migratory bird breeding season. If\nconstruction activities would occur during the migratory bird breeding\nseason, a nest survey should be conducted immediately prior to\nconstruction.",

In general, toe protection along Leyden Creek is proposed to allow for a\nfree meander of the low flow channel bottom, except in areas in close\nproximity to existing or proposed infrastructure. Bio-engineered methods\nand riparian vegetation is encouraged to be used as an alternate to\nriprap.  Two feet of cover above new storm sewers was assumed for all roadway\ncrossings. Whenever possible, two feet of clearance between the top of\nsanitary sewers and the bottom of culverts was proposed. When this\nclearance was not feasible due to the size of the required crossing\nstructure, one foot of clearance was provided along with a concrete\nencasement for the sanitary sewer. All other utilities were assumed to\nbe relocated, if required.  Grade control was established through a combination of sloping drop\nstructure, check structures and riffle drop structures.

The roadway expansion will include a\nstream crossing downstream of West 75 th  Place as well as two\npedestrian trail underpasses.  Twin 9 ft. x 4 ft. RCBC\u2019s are proposed to convey the 10-year discharge\nof 520 cfs below West 75 th  Place to meet Jefferson County Criteria.\nLess than 1 foot of depth of overtopping occurs during the 100-year\nevent. A concrete encasement of the sanitary sewer will also be required\nto accommodate the proposed culvert and allow two feet of roadway cover.\nA drop structure transition upstream of the road is also required. This\nproject will not have a significant impact on the floodplain and will\nnot remove the home downstream of West 75 th  Place from the floodplain.  To mitigate the roadway overtopping and shallow flooding that impacts\nproperty to the east of Alkire Street, new box culverts have been\nproposed. Four 12 ft. x 4 ft. RCBC\u2019s are required to convey the 100-year\ndischarge without overtopping the low point in Alkire Street. Headwater\ndepth at this location is limited by the sanitary crossing located east\nof the stream crossing. This project will require that the existing pond\nfeatures, upstream of Alkire Street, be adjusted and lowered\naccordingly. A 4 foot sloping drop structure is proposed to transition\nback into existing grades along the channel.  There are two existing structures in the floodplain downstream of the\nproposed project limits east of Alkire Street. Although these\nimprovements will not remove these structures from the 100-yr\nfloodplain, this project would alleviate the overtopping at Alkire\nStreet, removing eleven structures including six residential homes from\nthe shallow flooding hazard area.  Several check structures proposed within Reach 2 will stabilize the\nchannel slope preventing future channel degradation  The only known utility at West 75 th  Place is the sanitary sewer at an\napproximate depth of 8 feet.

            "text": "During the September 2013 event, spill flows from Leyden Creek diverted\neast, flooding areas within the Cameo Estates subdivision. Although the\nflood flows generally exceed that of the 100-year level, a project has\nbeen proposed to help mitigate future hazards. Mitigation in this area\nincludes re-grading of the pond bank east of Cameo Estates which will\nhelp keep flows within Leyden Creek and prevent overflows from spilling\ntowards the Cameo Estates subdivision. Costs have been included for the\npond embankment, and a new pond outlet structure. An easement cost has\nbeen included since the pond is located on private property and will\nrequire coordination with the project owner.  Downstream of the Croke Canal presents an opportunity for wetland\nmitigation. The wetlands south of Leyden Creek should be maintained and\nimproved during final design. A maintenance trail is included which\nshould be incorporated into any pedestrian trail expansion in the area.  At the Croke Canal a triple cell 10 ft. x 3 ft. RCBC will convey the\n100-year discharges underneath the canal eliminating the need for the\nexisting siphon and prevent any comingling of flows between the canal\nand Leyden Creek. The downstream bank of the canal will also be\nreinforced, with a defined spillway to protect the canal in the event\nthat overtopping occurs. The spillway was designed at the existing\novertopping elevation ensuring only flows in excess of the canal\ncapacity are discharged over the spillway. Feasibility of including a\npurge structure to reduce flows in the canal at this location should be\ninvestigated in the future between representatives from the Croke Canal\nand City of Arvada; however this purge structure has not been included\nin this plan, at this time.  Similarly, at Indiana Street a 10 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC is proposed to convey\nthe 100-year discharge below the roadway. Several drop structures are\nneeded throughout this reach to achieve the grade needed to eliminate\nthe siphon flow under the Croke Canal. The only two structures within\nthe 100-year floodplain would be removed by the implementation of this\nproject.  There are several known utilities in the project reach:    WATER:    24\u201d STL Consolidated raw water supply at Alkire Street    18\u201d PVC at Alkire Street      Century Link    XCEL Electric    Reach 3 Map  Reach 3 Profile",

            "text": "To incorporate the future pedestrian trail, a 180 ft. span bridge is\nproposed at Quaker Street. A 10 foot concrete pedestrian trail with 10\nfeet of clearance will provide access to the south along Quaker Street\nfor future trailhead and pedestrian bridge east of Quaker Street. Two\nsloping drop structures are proposed upstream of Quaker Street to allow\nadequate roadway cover. This plan follows the current alignment of\nQuaker Street. Future changes to Quaker Street should be considered with\nfinal design of the improvements. There are four structures in the\n100-year floodplain. The new channel and bridge will remove two of the\nstructures from the floodplain, while the other two structures area\nlocated upstream of the proposed project and would remain in the 100-yr\nfloodplain.  Throughout Pattridge Open Space, check structures have been proposed to\nstabilize the channel slope and prevent future degradation and erosion.  At West 82 nd  Avenue a five cell 10 ft. x 5 ft. RCBC crossing structure\nhas been proposed to convey the 100-year discharge below the roadway.\nSloping drop structures are required for roadway cover to transition\nbetween the existing and proposed channel elevations and to provide\ncover at the roadway. During final design spreading out the culverts\nalong West 82 nd  Avenue should be investigated to minimize grade change\nin the Pattridge Open Space area.  Upstream, at Blue Mountain Road, the existing crossing structure is\nproposed to be replaced with an 8 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC. Approximately 1300\nfeet of Blue Mountain Road is also proposed to also be reconstructed to\ngain adequate roadway cover over the proposed culverts and to prevent\novertopping back into the Leyden Creek Watershed. A double stacked 48\u201d\ngrouted boulder wall will prevent flows overtopping the railroad from\ncontributing to the Leyden Creek watershed. These flows will be conveyed\nunder Blue Mountain Road through a second 8 ft. x 6 ft. RCBC east of the\nstream crossing. The final design of elevating Blue Mountain Road should\ninvestigate any impacts to the homes and property downstream of Blue\nMountain Road.

            "text": "In general, drainage improvements should be constructed from downstream\nto upstream to avoid any adverse impacts. Due to the isolated nature of\neach alternative in the master plan, no adverse impacts would be\nexpected from implementing the proposed projects separately. A\ndiscussion on prioritization from an engineering perspective is\npresented below.  Priority 1 - Public Safety: \nFrom a public health and safety\nstandpoint the alternative with the highest priority of implementation\nwould be at Indiana Street and the Croke Canal crossing. This area was\nseverely impacted during the September 2013 event and required breaching\nof the Croke Canal to prevent further damages downstream. An\nuncontrolled breach of the canal could result in flood damages through\nthe Cameo Estates, and nearby neighborhoods. The implementation of this\nproject separates Leyden Creek 100-year discharges from the canal,\nfurther protecting the Canal\u2019s integrity during flood events. A\nformalized spill location has also been proposed to manage spill flows\nin excess of the canal capacity.  Priority 2 - Emergency Access: \nImprovements at West 82 nd  Avenue are\nrecommended next to improve localized access during storm events. During\nthe September 2013 flood this roadway was severely overtopping,\neliminating the possibility of vehicular use. Blue Mountain Road\npresents similar access concerns as West 82 nd  Avenue as it serves as\nthe primary access for residents in the area. By implementing roadway\nand culvert improvements, residents will have improved access during\nmajor storm events. Improvements at Blue Mountain Road will also reduce\ntrans basin inflows to the Leyden Creek watershed.  Priority 3 - Floodplain Reduction: \nSeveral structures are located\nwithin a shallow, 100-year, flood hazard area east of Alkire Street.\nImprovements at Alkire would convey flow underneath the roadway and\nreduce flood risk within these shallow flooding zones. Similarly,\nimproving the channel near Woodland Valley No. 7, upstream of West\n72 nd  Avenue would also remove the eight homes from the 100-year\nfloodplain. This improvement requires a minimal level of easement\nacquisition to implement the improvements.  Priority 4 - Minimum Flood Improvements: \nWhile the West 75 th  Place\nproject would not have significant impact on reducing 100-year\nfloodplain limits, this project would reduce the frequent flooding of\nthe roadway crossing.\u00a0 The project would convey all discharges up to the\n10-year event, whereas the existing crossing structure does not have the\ncapacity to convey the 2-year event.  Priority 5 - Future Roadway and Trail Needs: \nAlthough projects at\nWest 72 nd  Avenue to Simms Street and at Quaker Street will remove\nseveral properties from the floodplain, each of these projects will\nrequire significant easements from private properties to implement the\nimprovements. For these reasons, is it recommended that these two\nprojects be implemented alongside, or ahead of, other City needs\nincluding roadway expansion projects or extensions of the regional trail\nnetwork.",
