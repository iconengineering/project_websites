    </div>
              <h4 id="section11">1.1 Authorization</h4>
              <p>This report was authorized by the Town of Milliken under the April 2014 agreement regarding "Storm Drainage Master Plan, Utility Fee Assessment, and Storm Drainage Criteria Manual Update". Notice to proceed was provided by the Town of Milliken on April 16, 2014.</p>
              <h4 id="section12">1.2 Purpose &amp; Scope</h4>
              <p>ICON Engineering, Inc. has been placed under contract by the Town of Milliken to prepare an update to the Town's 1982 drainage Master Plan. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the watershed tributary to the Town, identify existing system deficiencies, and to develop an alternatives plan for mitigation of flood problems, stormwater conveyance, and water quality improvement. Methodology and calculations for this analysis focus on the 100-year storm event, although calculations for the 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 500-year return periods were also developed.</p>
              <p>The following is a summary of the scope of work completed for this study:</p>
              <ol type="1">
                <li>Coordination and meetins with the Town and project stakeholders;</li>
                <li>Hydrologic Analysis &mdash;</li>

              <h4 id="section13">1.3 Planning Process</h4>
              <p>One hydrologic study has been previously developed for the Town of Milliken, as part of a report entitled <i>"Flood Plain Information, Drainage Plan and Street Improvement Plan at Milliken, Colorado"</i> <button type="button" class="reference btn btn-info" data-toggle="popover" title="Reference 1" data-content="Simons, Li &amp; Associates, Inc, <i>Flood Plain Information, Drainage Plan and Street Improvement Plan at Milliken, Colorado</i>, October 1982" data-html="true"><span class="refbutton">1</span></button>, dated October 1982. Additionally, in 1979, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) completed a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the Milliken area, however, this study focuses on the Little Thompson River, and not areas tributary to downtown Milliken.</p>
              <p>Progress meetings were held to discuss project status and technical approach for the project. Philosophical goals for alternatives were discussed at periodic progress meetings.</p>
              <p>Within the Town of Milliken, the goals for the project include:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The reduction of the threat to human life and property caused by localized flooding;</li>
                  <li>To provide a basis for the management of future development within the Town;</li>
                  <li>To determine the most economically feasible flood control alternative for local drainage problem areas;</li>
                  <li>Increasing detention to mitigate hydrologic changes due to land use;</li>
                  <li>Increased conveyance capacity at canal and railroad crossings;</li>
                  <li>Use of regional detention to minimize required conveyance</li>
                </ol>
              <p>A kickoff meeting was held on May 8, 2014 to introduce project sponsors and understand the goals for this Master Plan. Subsequent meetings were held regularly to discuss hydrologic and hydraulic results, alternative plans, and to review comments.</p>
              <p>This master plan, like its predecessor, is developed in close coordination with the greater flood recovery planning process. The flood event on September 12, 2013 triggered the immediate and long term responses to increasing risk awareness and resiliency. The Colorado Water Conservation Board has a full history of the 2013 flood event.</p>
              <p>The Town’s master plan process follows closely along with the local, regional, state, and federal recovery, planning, and mitigation processes to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated plan for the Town’s resiliency to flooding and other related natural disasters. At the time of this report, there are still many technical and administrative details related to the flood recovery that are undetermined. For example, flood studies on the Big Thompson and Little Thompson Rivers have not published revised hydrologic estimates for the respective basins. Therefore, all flood recovery mapping and related work on these flood sources has used the effective FEMA hydrology. Notably, the flood recovery mapping provided by the Colorado Water Conservation Board, on the Little Thompson through the Town of Milliken is based on FEMA effective flows and fully blocked crossings. As additional details are provided, these studies may be revised. It is possible revised base flood event hydrology for the Little Thompson River could be released in 2015. Other mitigation grants and programs also remain in progress.</p>
              <p>There are a number of grants and programs that were coordinated with the development of this master plan. The Department of Labor and Affairs (DOLA), Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), and Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) were all programs the Town Staff and associated partners have spent considerable time through 2013 and 2014 to leverage the best possible outcome for the Town and its residents.</p>
              <p>A unique and noteworthy point for this master plan is the coordinated public outreach between the State Flood Recovery mapping project, grant programs, and the master plan. Summarized by the Town’s public meeting records, nearly every public meeting on any one of the aforementioned projects or plans related to the Town’s master planning process. As drainage knows no administrative boundaries, stormwater master planning involves local, regional, state and federal efforts to ensure a coordinated approach.</p>
              <p>As of the date of this report, the Floodplain Recovery Mapping is complete – the Town’s adoption of the floodplain was recorded in March 2014. The CDBG Traunch 1 application was submitted, funded, and implemented. The CDBG Traunch 2 application has been submitted and is awaiting award notice. The HMGP application was submitted in August and is awaiting award notice.</p>

              <h4 id="section14">1.4 Mapping &amp; Surveys</h4>
              <p>LiDAR mapping, completed in January 2014, was obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for use on this project. The LiDAR dataset included 0.35-meter ground sampling distance, provided on NAVD 88 vertical datum and the NAD 83 horizontal datum. Supplemental ground survey was completed by Lamp, Rynearson &amp; Associates in summer of 2014. Additional mapping for existing utilities was provided by the Town of Milliken in CAD format.</p>

              <h4 id="section15">1.5 Data Collection</h4>
              <p>Multiple drainage studies and as-built construction documents were collected from the Town of Milliken. The primary references used for this study are as follows:</p>

    </div>
              <h4 id="section21">2.1 Project Area</h4>
              <p>The watershed area studied for this Master Plan update is approximately 19.8 square miles in size, divided into five main flow paths, designated herein as the Western Tributary, the Lola Park Tributary, the Eastern Tributary, the Big Thompson Tributary, and the Northern Tributary. The Lola Park and Western tributaries discharge into the Little Thompson River, while the Northern, Eastern, and Big Thompson tributaries drain to the Big Thompson River.</p>
            <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-9">
              <p>The Western, Eastern, and Lola Park Tributaries are generally located south of downtown Milliken, extending nearly to the South Platte River. South of County Road 46 (County Road 46), these watersheds are, for the most part, undeveloped, although they are zoned for future development. The undeveloped areas consist mainly of farmland or open range, with several small single family developments. North of County Road 46, the development generally intensifies, with smaller-lot single family residential areas dominating, including some commercial areas in the downtown portion of Milliken. These tributaries vary in elevation from a high of approximately 4960’, to a low of 4730’. The soil types are a mix of Hydrologic Soil Group B, C, and D, as defined by the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The majority of the soils in the upper watershed areas are type C, with areas in the Town generally type B, and only a small fraction of type D soils. The average slope across these tributaries is very flat, at approximately 0.8%.</p>

As with the other tributaries, it consists mainly of open space rangeland, with some single family residential development centered around the Mad Russian Golf Course. The Northern Tributaries are generally long, thin watersheds, each discharging to a separate point along the Big Thompson River. Although some of these areas are outside of the Town limits, they were included in order to properly account for any future changes that may occur related to the Town’s road right-of-way in that basin. The Northern Tributary includes several watersheds directly tributary to the Big Thompson River, downstream of the confluence with the Little Thompson River. These watersheds discharge across a portion of Town property which connects the future Homestead at Ashton subdivision to the Old Town area. The Northern Tributary ranges in elevation from a high of 5050’ to a low of 4710’ along the Big Thompson River. Soils are predominately type B, with a small amount of type C soil located in the higher portion of the watershed. The Northern Tributary is steeper than the other tributaries, with an average slope of approximately 2.2%.</p>
            <p>The Big Thompson Tributary is located east of the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR), south of the Big Thompson River. The Settler’s Village development is located in the Big Thompson Tributary. It also contains isolated pockets of industrial development, as well as the Town water treatment plant. This tributary is relatively flat river bottom area, with elevations ranging from 4748’ to 4718’. The soils are mostly type B, with a small amount of type D soil in the south. Average slopes across the Big Thompson Tributary are approximately 0.4%.</p>
            <p>Runoff generated by the five tributaries is conveyed through both open and closed conduit systems, depending on location. In undeveloped areas, conveyance is almost exclusively via open channels and roadway crossings. Storm sewers and roadways (including borrow ditches) are used to convey stormwater runoff in developed areas.</p>
            <p>A total of five existing formal detention facilities were considered in this report. They include Ehrlich Lake, the Settler’s Village Pond at County Road 46 and CR25, Centennial Lake, located north of the Settler’s Village Pond on State Highway 60, and the Centennial Farms Pond at the intersection of Alice Avenue and County Road 46. The Pheasant Hills Sump, located on CR21 at the Lola Park Tributary crossing, was also included in this study, despite its lack of a formal outlet structure. Alternatives for additional detention facilities, such as ponds on the downstream end of Lola Tributary, are discussed later in this report.</p>
            <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>Stormwater is also inadvertently intercepted by several existing irrigation ditches located in Milliken. The Little Thompson Ditch is located south of Town, bordering the Centennial Farms subdivision. The Hillsboro Canal, and several of its laterals, flow just south of the Frank Farms subdivision, before joining the Little Thompson Ditch upstream of Centennial Farms. The Platte/Thompson Ditch is located north of State Highway 60, and presents an impediment to flows, since few crossing structures exist over or under this canal. The Beeline Ditch flows under Quentine Avenue just south of Broad Street before joining the Platte/Thompson Ditch.</p>
            <p>There are also several railroads within the Town. The Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) owns a mainline that crosses east of Town, running to the north and west, crossing Alice Avenue, Broad Street, and the Big and Little Thompson Rivers. This railroad embankment also serves as a pond embankment for Ehrlich Lake. The UPRR also owns a spur line approximately two blocks north of Broad Street, which parallels Broad Street to the west. Both of these railroad lines impede the Western, Eastern, and Lola Park Tributaries natural flow paths.</p>

            <h4 id="section22">2.2 Land Use</h4>
            <p>Zoning data was provided by the Town of Milliken for use on this project. Zoning maps were provided in pdf format and digitized for use in GIS software. Table 2.1 below lists the impervious values listed for various land uses. Land use values were applied consistently with other planning studies, specifically the Hydrologic Analysis of the Box Elder Creek/Cooper Slough Watershed.<button type="button" class="reference btn btn-info" data-toggle="popover" title="Reference 2" data-content="Icon Engineering, Inc., <i>Hydrologic Analysis of the Box Elder Creek/Cooper Slough Watershed<i>, April 2014" data-html="true"><span class="refbutton">2</span></button> Detailed watershed parameters are discussed in Section 3 of this report.</p>
            <p>Existing land uses were based on current zoning and development levels. Currently developed areas consist mainly of medium density, single-family residential areas in addition to some estate lot residential housing. Commercial uses are mainly limited to areas within one block of Broad Street, with the exception of a commercial strip mall along Alice Avenue just south of SH60. Some industrial uses exist, mainly in the Big Thompson Tributary. The majority of the areas within the Town boundary are currently undeveloped, existing as open rangeland or irrigated cropland.</p>
            <p>Future imperviousness values were determined based on zoning, and a map entitled “Estimated Milliken Growth”, provided by the Town (included in Appendix D).  This map shows areas within the Town boundary that are currently under construction, have pending development applications, expected future annexations, and land expected to be developed. For the future land use conditions, impervious values anticipate development based on land use and zoning information collected from the Town. Inside the Old Town area, the watershed is primarily developed, resulting in similar land use for both existing and future conditions.  South of Old Town, higher impervious values result from the planned development areas.</p>

              <p>Due to the various outfall locations along the Little Thompson and Big Thompson Rivers, drainage areas tributary to the Town have been broken into 5 tributaries, the Western Tributary, the Lola Park Tributary, the Eastern Tributary, the Big Thompson Tributary, and the Northern Tributary. Generally, stormwater runoff is conveyed by open channels higher in the basin. Where runoff enters the developed portion of the Town, it is generally split between open channel (streets and drainage channels) and storm sewer conveyance.</p>

                  <p>The Western Tributary is located on the far west edge of Milliken, originating approximately one-half mile south of County Road 46 near County Road 19, and is approximately 400 acres in size. Development within the Western Tributary consists of medium density single family development and farmland, with an existing weighted imperviousness of approximately 12%.  Based on the Estimated Milliken Growth map, development is expected to increase in the Western Tributary with the expansion of the Pheasant Hills subdivision and the construction of the Purvis and Dove Valley PUDs, causing the future imperviousness to increase to 32%.</p>
                  <p>Runoff originating from the Western Tributary is conveyed through overland flow, where it crosses the Hillsboro Canal and the Little Thompson Ditch near County Road 46. Flows then collect in the Frank Farms subdivision at the S. Ursula Court cul-de-sac, where they split to the north and east. A storm sewer in Quentine Avenue intercepts a portion of the 100-year discharge, with the remainder conveyed by the swales along Quentine. This storm sewer eventually daylights near the intersection of State Highway 257 and Quentine before outfalling to the Little Thompson River.</p>

                    <p>The Lola Park Tributary is approximately 3,050 acres in size, and originates near the intersection of County Road 17 and County Road 40, approximately 4 miles south of Johnstown. Development within the watershed is currently dominated by farmland, in addition to the Wildcat Acres subdivision. Inside the Town limits, development consists mainly of single family residential in the Old Town area, with some commercial uses. The existing weighted imperviousness of the basin is only 6%, due to the large tracts of undeveloped land. Significant development is expected to occur in the upper Lola Park watershed.  Imperviousness is expected to increase to approximately 21% in the future.</p>
                    <p>The Lola Park Tributary is conveyed via open channel flow from County Road 42 until runoff is intercepted by a sump in the Pheasant Hills development. This sump does not have a formal outlet structure, and is very large, with a capacity of approximately 171 ac-ft, according to SWMM modeling results. Spills from this sump travel north across County Road 46, where S. Irene Avenue diverts a small portion of the discharge north towards Lola Park, with the majority of the flows directed to the Eastern Tributary.  Downstream of Lola Park, discharges are conveyed by both open and closed conduits before crossing the Platte/Thompson Ditch and outfalling into the Little Thompson River. The Milliken Fire Station improvements in 2007-2008 included a 10’x3’ box culvert and a small detention pond on the Lola Tributary.  An existing corrugated metal culvert conveys undetermined irrigation return flows out of Lola Trib downstream of the Fire Station culvert.</p>

It is approximately 1,175 acres in size, and contains a mixture of farmland and residential development. The Centennial Farms and Colony Pointe developments are located in the Eastern Tributary, as well as the eastern portion of Old Town Milliken. Its current imperviousness is estimated at 13%, with significant development expected to occur in the future. According to the Estimated Milliken Growth map, the majority of the watershed is zoned for residential development, causing the imperviousness to increase to 43%.</p>
                    <p>Runoff from the Eastern Tributary is collected by a pick-up ditch just south of the Hillsboro Canal at Centennial Farms, as noted in the Final Drainage Report for the Centennial Farms Subdivision.<button type="button" class="reference btn btn-info" data-toggle="popover" title="Reference 3" data-content="RMC, July 2000, <i>Final Drainage Report for Centennial Farms Subdivision</i>" data-html="true"><span class="refbutton">3</span></button> This ditch conveys off-site flows around Centennial Farms to the east, nearly to the Union Pacific Railroad. At that point, they cross County Road 46 to the north, and discharge into Ehrlich Lake. As noted above, spill flows from the Lola Park Tributary are also conveyed by the Eastern Tributary. These flows originate from a flow split on the Lola Park Tributary near S. Irene Avenue and County Road 46. They are conveyed via overland flow to the intersection of Alice Avenue and the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR), where they spill into Ehrlich Lake. A small pipe, insufficient to convey the 100-year discharge, crosses the railroad at this point. Downstream of the railroad, a concrete lined ditch in poor condition conveys flows to the Big Thompson River (photo 3). </p>

                  <p style="padding-top:15px;">Located north of Milliken, the Northern Tributary is a collection of individual ephemeral streams, rather than a single watershed. It covers an area of approximately 6,320 acres, and consists mainly of relatively steep farmland. The Mad Russian Golf Course is located on the west side of the watershed, and is surrounded by single family residential housing. With that exception, the Northern Tributary is almost entirely undeveloped. Its existing imperviousness is estimated at only 3%, with the future imperviousness expected to increase to only 6%, due to some expected development around the golf course, the Homestead at Ashton subdivision, and a general business development.</p>
                  <p>In the Northern Tributary areas, runoff is conveyed almost entirely through open channel flow and roadway culverts, since the majority of these areas are undeveloped.

Its current imperviousness is estimated at approximately 35%, with the future imperviousness expected to increase to approximately 68%, due to the industrial zonings. The Settler’s Village development, currently under construction, was considered as fully developed for the existing hydrologic analysis. </p>
                  <p>Runoff from the Big Thompson Tributary is conveyed in storm sewers through Settler’s Village to Centennial Lake. Discharges from the lake are released at a controlled level, crossing under SH60 before outfalling to the Big Thompson River. Runoff from subwatersheds 415 (the southern half of Settler’s Village) and 836 discharge east under the UPRR, outfalling to the South Platte River. The Settler’s Village south pond is located in subwatershed 415, which detains runoff from the development before discharging under the UPRR.</p>

            <h4 id="section24">2.4 Flood History</h4>
            <p>The 1982 stormwater master plan references several past flooding events affecting the Town. These include a rainfall event in June of 1981 which resulted in 2 to 2.5 inches of rainfall over the watershed. This event caused localized, limited damages, including several roadway washouts, but no major structural damage reported. Another event was noted in June 1982, when up to 3 inches of rain fell in one hour. This storm damaged approximately 50 structures, and overtopped the Union Pacific railroad on the Eastern Tributary, in addition to extensive private and public damages along County Road 23.</p>
            <p>Milliken was also severely impacted by the flood of September 2013. Between September 10 and September 14, 2013, a rain gage in the Lola Park Tributary recorded a total of 4.28” of rain, 2.2” of which occurred on September 12. Flooding below Broad Street was widespread, due to overflows from the Little Thompson River. These flows caused structural damage to the UPRR crossing at the Little Thompson River, as well as the spur line that parallels Broad Street. Flooding from the Little Thompson also caused the intersection of Broad Street and Quentine Avenue to flood (photos 4-7).</p>

              <h4 id="section31">3.1 Overview</h4>
              <p>This study will update the Town of Milliken hydrology for the 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, 100-, and 500-year storm frequencies under both existing and future development conditions. The Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP) version 1.4.3 was used to develop runoff hydrographs from individual sub-watersheds within each watershed. The EPA Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) version 5.0.22 was used to route the hydrographs through the watershed.</p>
              <p>The study area for Milliken encompasses 19.8 square miles, divided into five main flow paths. A total of 81 subwatersheds are included in the hydrologic analysis. The average watershed size is approximately 156 acres. Due to the size of the watersheds, a 5-minute unit hydrograph was used in CUHP, per recommendations in the Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual (USDCM).<button type="button" class="reference btn btn-info" data-toggle="popover" title="Reference 4" data-content="Urban Drainage &amp; Flood Control District, <i>Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual</i>,  April 2008" data-html="true"><span class="refbutton">4</span></button> For the current update, the overall watershed boundary was determined to be very similar to the watershed boundary used for the 1982 stormwater master plan, although the subwatershed delineations were slightly different.</p>

              <p>The 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50, 100, and 500-year rainfall depths were verified from the <i>NOAA Atlas 2 – Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the Western United States, Volume III -Colorado</i>,<button type="button" class="reference btn btn-info" data-toggle="popover" title="Reference 5" data-content="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, <i>NOAA Atlas 2 Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the Western United States, Volume III – Colorado</i>, 1973" data-html="true"><span class="refbutton">5</span></button> as recommended by the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District (UDFCD) for areas outside of the district boundary, as was done for the 1982 stormwater master plan. These values were verified for the current study and found to be in conformance with the NOAA Atlas and current modeling practices; therefore, they were carried forward for use. Aerial adjustments were not applied, as the total tributary area to any design point is less than 10 square miles.</p>
              <p>Please note that NOAA has recently updated their rainfall atlas with revised rainfall values. However, the updated values are not endorsed for use by the UDFCD, as outlined in a recent position letter<button type="button" class="reference btn btn-info" data-toggle="popover" title="Reference 6" data-content="Urban Drainage and Flood Control District, <i>UDFCD Position on the NOAA Atlas 14 Precipitation-Frequency Atlas, Volume 8</i>, September 2013" data-html="true"><span class="refbutton">6</span></button> by the UDFCD. Since these values are not advised for use by the UDFCD, and since the Town of Milliken has adopted UDFCD criteria, the older values were utilized.</p>

              <h4 id="section33">3.3 Subwatershed Characteristics</h4>
              <p>For the current study, subwatershed boundaries were re-drawn based on the LiDAR topography described above.  Initially, the subwatersheds were delineated based on 10-foot contour mapping, and the 2- or 1-foot mapping was reviewed as necessary to adjust the boundaries. The subwatersheds range from 4.8 acres to 1,114 acres, with an average size of 156 acres. Generally, subwatersheds in developed areas of Town are delineated on a finer basis than the undeveloped areas. Areas outside of the Town boundary directly tributary to the Big or Little Thompson Rivers were excluded from this study. Additionally, the canals within the study area were assumed to be flowing full during a rainfall event, as was done with the 1982 stormwater master plan. Therefore, their influence on basin delineation was ignored.</p>
              <p>Imperviousness for each subwatershed was based on the updated land use and zoning information described in Section 2.2. For the future conditions, percent impervious values were generated to reflect anticipated future development based on land use and zoning information from the Town of Milliken.  Impervious percentages were applied from recommendations presented in the USDCM, or taken directly from drainage reports, as applicable.  For developed areas, impervious values were generally similar to the values used in the 1982 stormwater master plan. However, the current study reduced the impervious values of the undeveloped areas, from 7% to 2%, based on UDFCD recommendations and current practices. Modeling parameters such as subwatershed length, distance to centroid, and slope were calculated using a GIS interface. These parameters are summarized in Table A.2, located in Appendix A. </p>
              <p>Several differences were noted in the hydrologic parameters between the 1982 stormwater master plan and current recommendations from the USDCM. Specifically, the 1982 stormwater master plan used infiltration rates significantly higher than recommended by current practice, and decay rates significantly lower than current practice. These parameters were revised to ensure consistency with current UDFCD recommendations. Additionally, the depression losses were decreased from 0.4” to 0.35”, per current recommendations.</p>
              <h4 id="section34">3.4 Hydrograph Routing</h4>
              <p>Individual hydrographs developed for each subwatershed were routed throughout the basin using the EPA-SWMM program. Routing elements in SWMM consist of a system of channels, pipes, and storage elements. Conduit dimensions were determined through a GIS interface and current topographic mapping, in addition to field surveys. Roughness coefficients were selected in accordance with recommendations presented in the USDCM.</p>
              <p>Five detention facilities were included in the SWMM modeling. These ponds include the Centennial Farms pond, Centennial Lake, Ehrlich Lake, the Settler’s Village south pond, and the Pheasant Hills sump. Storage volumes for all detention areas were taken from the LiDAR contour mapping. For the Centennial Farms and Settler’s Village ponds, and Centennial Lake, the outflow characteristics were taken from their individual drainage reports. All three of these ponds limit their 100-year release to a maximum of 6 cfs. For the Pheasant Hills sump and Ehrlich Lake, the outflow characteristics were calculated based on field surveys and outlet dimensions. The Pheasant Hills sump does not have a controlled outlet, but rather fills to an elevation of approximately 4793’ before spilling to the north across the Hillsboro Canal.</p>
              <p>A total of two detention basins were included in the 1982 stormwater master plan. These include two small ponds on the Lola Park tributary. Based on current UDFCD eligibility criteria, neither pond was included for the current hydrology update.</p>
              <h4 id="section35">3.5 Previous Studies and Results of Analysis</h4>
              <p>A summary of the hydrologic analysis can be found in Appendix A. The 1982 stormwater master plan is the only previous source of hydrologic results from the area, so comparisons are made at select design points between the current and previous studies. It was found that the current update results in higher peak discharges in all areas than the 1982 stormwater master plan. The 1982 stormwater master plan used SWMM to generate runoff hydrographs, whereas the current update uses CUHP, which can introduce differences in the peak runoff rates due to differences in the software. The current update also uses a lower infiltration rate than previously estimated, causing additional runoff to occur.</p>
              <p>Changes were also made to the runoff routing for the current update. As mentioned above, the Lola Park Tributary is diverted near S. Irene Avenue and County Road 46. The majority of the 100-year discharge is routed east towards Alice Avenue. This diversion was not modeled in the 1982 stormwater master plan, causing discharges along Alice Avenue to increase significantly. Increased development in the Western and Lola Park Tributaries have also caused an increase in runoff rates. Table 3.2 includes a brief flow comparison, selected at locations that were directly comparable.</p>
              <p>Table 3.3 also includes a summary of existing and future discharges across all return periods at selected design points in the watershed. Note that the Northern and Big Thompson tributaries are not included in this table, since they mostly consist of independent subwatersheds, rather than a specific drainageway.</p>

    </div>
            <h4 id="section41">4.1 Evaluation of Existing Facilities</h4>
              <p>Hydraulic analysis of existing infrastructure within the Town of Milliken was performed in order to determine the capacity and approximate return periods of conveyance systems and detention ponds. Several modeling programs were used to complete this analysis, most notably EPA-SWMM 5.0.22, FLO-2D Pro, and FlowMaster. The capacity of existing closed conduit systems was estimated from SWMM computations generated as part of the hydrologic analysis of this report. Inlet control nomographs were used with the project mapping to estimate culvert capacities where necessary. Detention ponds were modeling using SWMM as part of the hydrologic analysis. </p>
            <h4 id="section42">4.2 Existing Drainage Facilities</h4>
              <p>Existing drainage facilities throughout the Town vary in size, shape and material. Capacity of the existing infrastructure also fluctuates and is generally undersized compared to the future conditions discharges.  In the undeveloped portions of Town, there is a near-complete lack of infrastructure entirely.  For example, ‘texas crossings’ at several gravel roads where no culverts have been installed at the low point of the creek or swale. Table 4.1 includes an inventory of the existing drainage infrastructure in the Town, as well as its approximate capacity and return period.</p>

                  <p style="padding-top:15px;">Drainage facilities in the Western Tributary are generally limited to S. Quentine Avenue. In the year 2000, a storm sewer system was constructed in Quentine, consisting of HDPE pipe ranging from 60” diameter at Broad Street, to 30” at S. Lilac Street. This storm sewer uses a series of area inlets along Quentine to intercept runoff. Discharges above the capacity of this pipe are conveyed by the shallow roadside ditches along Quentine. At Broad Street, this system connects to a 76” x 48” horizontal elliptical pipe that crosses under the Beeline Ditch and daylights just south of SH257. At this point, a double 10’x6’ box culvert conveys discharges under SH257. Directly downstream from SH257, the Western Tributary passes under the UPRR with a double 48” RCP culvert.</p>
                </div>
                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="lola2">
                    <p style="padding-top:15px;">Drainage infrastructure in the Lola Park Tributary consists of a mixture of open- and closed-conduit conveyance, all of which are undersized for the 100-year developed runoff.  Runoff overtops County Road 42 and County Road 44, as well as S. Quentine Avenue, before ponding in the Pheasant Hills sump, located just east of Quentine at the Wildcat Acres subdivision. This sump area is owned by the Town, and was constructed when a local developer needed fill dirt, according to Town anecdotes.  It does not contain a formal release structure to control discharges. Rather, it fills to a depth of approximately 10 feet before spilling north across the Hillsboro Canal. The canal was assumed to be flowing full during a rainfall event, and as a result, any conveyance capacity in the canal was ignored. According to SWMM results, shown in Table 3.4, the pond does not discharge until the existing 10-year runoff event is exceeded, or the future 5-year event.</p>
                    <p>Runoff continues north, overtopping County Road 46 due to the lack of a crossing structure in this location. It then travels a short distance to S. Irene Avenue, before again overtopping Irene due to a lack of a formal crossing structure. A small borrow ditch on the west side of Irene intercepts a small portion of the 100-year event, routing these flows north to Lola Park, with the remainder of the discharge flowing to the north and east, towards Alice Avenue.</p>
                    <p>At Green Street, a small ditch conveys flows from the Wal Mar development east to Lola Park, where they combine with flows from the higher tributary area. A moderately sized open channel conveys runoff to the northeast corner of Lola Park, where a double 54” RCP culvert intercepts the majority of the 100-year discharge in this area. Overflows travel north on Irene.  Downstream of Forest Street, the double 54” culvert discharges into an open channel, which conveys flows to Elm. A double 66”x44” horizontal elliptical pipe crosses Elm. Both the Elm Street crossing and the open channel appear to be poorly maintained, due to the accumulation of sediment and overgrowth in the channel. Runoff in excess of the Elm Street culvert capacity spills to Irene, joining spill flows from above. Irene conveys these discharges north across Broad Street. A small bridge conveys flows across the Platte/Thompson Ditch, before outfalling to the Little Thompson River. </p>
                    <p>Just downstream of Elm, a 10’x3’ box culvert was constructed as part of the Fire Station improvements. Downstream of this culvert, a small water quality pond collects flows, where they are conveyed under Broad Street by a double 68”x42” horizontal elliptical pipe. This pipe discharges onto N. Josephine Avenue, which conveys runoff to the Platte/Thompson Ditch. Downstream of the ditch, an open channel carries runoff to the UPRR, crossing under the railroad through a double 54” RCP, where it is conveyed to the Little Thompson River.</p>

                    <p style="padding-top:15px;">Runoff in the upper portion of the Eastern Tributary is conveyed via overland flow until the Centennial Farms development. At this point, as noted in the “Final Drainage Report for the Centennial Farms Subdivision”<button type="button" class="reference btn btn-info" data-toggle="popover" title="Reference 3" data-content="RMC, July 2000, <i>Final Drainage Report for Centennial Farms Subdivision</i>" data-html="true"><span class="refbutton">3</span></button>, a pick-up ditch intercepts discharges from the upper watershed before they cross the Hillsboro Canal, conveying them to the east across County Road 23. At this point, a small ditch carries flows nearly to the intersection of County Road 46 and the UPRR, where a double 5’x3’ horizontal elliptical pipe conveys flows north across County Road 46. A larger open channel then conveys flows north to Ehrlich Lake. Prior to Ehrlich Lake, a 48” RCP intercepts a portion of the 100-year discharge, with overtopping discharges conveyed via overland flow to the Lake.</p>
                    <p>The Eastern Tributary also conveys spill flows from the Lola Park Tributary. These flows originate near S. Irene Avenue and County Road 46. From this intersection, spills are conveyed in a very wide and shallow sheet flow fashion, inundating almost the entire vacant quarter section of unincorporated land east of Irene. Some of these spills overtop Alice and enter Ehrlich Lake, however, some stormwater also flows towards S. Cora Avenue, inundating the intersection of Cora and Forest Street, where they eventually pond at the UPRR embankment near the eastern end of Elm Street.</p>
                    <p>The UPRR embankment in this area serves as an impediment to the natural flow path of the Eastern Tributary, and there is no cross drainage structure in this area to convey flows east. According to Town officials, this area is a source of frequent ponding.</p>
                    <p>Ehrlich Lake was constructed as part of the Colony Pointe subdivision in approximately 2001, according to the “Final Drainage Report for the Colony Pointe Subdivision”.<button type="button" class="reference btn btn-info" data-toggle="popover" title="Reference 8" data-content="RMC, July 2000, <i>Final Drainage Report for the Colony Pointe Subdivision at Milliken, Colorado</i>" data-html="true"><span class="refbutton">8</span></button> It provides approximately 152 acre-feet of stormwater detention. The pond outlet consists of a 48” RCP which crosses under the UPRR, and extends north to the intersection of Alice Avenue and Broad Street, where it discharges into a ditch that parallels Alice on the east. This ditch is concrete lined and poorly maintained, although it does have sufficient capacity to convey 100-year existing discharges to the Big Thompson River. However, the crossing structures at the Platte/Thompson Ditch, County Road 48, and County Road 23 are undersized. These crossings consist of a 54” and a-60” pipe repsectively.</p>
                    <p>The detention pond for the Centennial Farms subdivision was also included in SWMM modeling for the Eastern Tributary. This pond was constructed in the early 2000’s as part of the Centennial Farms development. It is relatively small, providing approximately 10 ac-ft of detention volume. Discharges from this pond are conveyed by the open channel which parallels the south side of County Road 46.</p>

                  <p style="padding-top:15px;">Runoff in the Northern Tributaries is conveyed by open channels and roadside ditches. Although there are multiple retention/detention ponds in the area, such as at the Mad Russian Golf Course, none of them meet eligibility criteria for regional detention. Runoff is conveyed entirely via open channel flow in the Northern Tributary, with the exception of several culvert crossings.</p>
                </div>
                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="bigthompson2">
                  <p style="padding-top:15px;">Runoff in this tributary is conveyed by storm sewers in Settler’s Village, and by open channels in areas outside the development. Besides the storm sewer in Settler’s Village, very little infrastructure exists in the Big Thompson Tributary. Two ponds were included in the SWMM modeling for the Big Thompson Tributary. These include Centennial Lake, and the Settler’s Village South Pond. Both of these structures are located in the Settler’s Village development, and were constructed in the early 2000’s with the surrounding housing. Centennial Lake is at the intersection of CR60 and CR25. It is a relatively large retention/detention area which collects runoff from majority of Settler’s Village. The Settler’s Village South Pond is approximately one-quarter mile south of Centennial Lake, and it also serves as a retention/detention structure, detaining runoff from the southern portion of the development. They provide a respective 41 ac-ft and 13 ac-ft of detention volume for Settler’s Village.</p>

              <h4 id="section43">4.3 Flood Hazards</h4>
                  <p>The majority of the flood hazards within the study area have resulted from the elimination of natural flow paths and/or insufficient conveyance capacity of the existing drainage facilities. As the Town has developed over time, the natural flow paths, such as along the Lola Park Tributary, have been encroached or blocked by railroad or roadway embankments. In most cases, cross-drainage is insufficient or non-existent, leading to residual backwater ponding, causing flooding throughout the Town. Inundation areas are mostly limited to residential areas, although commercial property along Broad Street is also at risk. The results of this report generally verify the flood hazards presented in the 1982 stormwater master plan. An inventory of the existing drainage facilities, and their approximate return period prior to overtopping (based on existing conditions hydrology) is shown in Table 4.1. These areas are also identified in Appendix B, and discussed on a tributary-by-tributary basis below.</p>

                  <p style="padding-top:15px;">Flood hazards in the Western Tributary are generally related to insufficient storm sewer capacity along S. Quentine Avenue and the Hillsboro and Little Thompson Ditch crossings. Since there is no formal crossing structure of either of the canals, stormwater will tend to pond and spill via sheet flow to the north, damaging structures in its path, including those in the Dove Valley and Frank Farms subdivisions. The lack of a formalized collection and conveyance system for these upper basin discharges exacerbates flooding in Frank Farms, where up to approximately 40 structures face the potential for inundation.</p>
                  <p>In Quentine, the existing drainage system, including the swales along the road, are insufficiently sized to convey the 100-year discharge. Flows from the watershed drain to Quentine, overwhelming the existing drainage system. The roadside ditches lacks the capacity to convey these flows, and during the 100-year runoff event, this ditch spills near Green Street, and also near Broad Street, flooding residences to the east of Quentine.</p>
                </div>
                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="lola3">
                    <p style="padding-top:15px;">As shown in Table 4.1, there is minimal conveyance infrastructure in the Lola Park Tributary, with limited storm sewer in Old Town. In the undeveloped areas high in the watershed, runoff overtops the gravel roadways, due to the lack of cross-drainage capacity. As runoff spills from the Pheasant Hills pond, it is uncontrolled, spilling via sheet flow across the Hillsboro Canal lateral that borders the north side of the pond and overtopping a wide stretch of County Road 46. These discharges eventually inundate the entire area bordered by S. Marjorie Avenue, S. Alice Avenue, County Road 46, and Green Street (extended). The majority of these flows are eventually intercepted by the Eastern Tributary, with SWMM modeling indicating that only 55 cfs is actually conveyed to Lola Park.</p>
                    <p>The hydraulic analysis indicates that the existing 54” pipes exiting Lola Park are slightly undersized for the 100-year runoff event. The open channels and crossing structures between Forest and Broad Streets all lack capacity, spilling once the 10-year event is exceeded. Spill flows from these structures inundate Irene Avenue as they travel north, spreading into Harriet, Grace, and Frances Streets.</p>
                    <p>North of Broad Street, the existing 2-68”x42” HERCP crossing structure outfalls to Josephine Avenue, where a lack of conveyance infrastructure causes these flows to spread across both mobile home parks adjacent to Josephine. Since these spills are uncontained, many of them are routed around the Platte/Thompson Ditch crossing structure. The culverts at the UPRR also lack the capacity for the 100-year discharge.  The convergence of undersized storm sewers and overflow paths occurs at Josephine and Broad Street.  With the Platte/Thompson Ditch restricting outflow, the result is a sump condition, in a residential area without auxiliary dry-land emergency access during localized and regional flood events.  Existing public and private property is threatened by multiple flood hazards in this area.</p>

                    <p style="padding-top:15px;">Flood hazards in the Eastern Tributary are magnified by the large spill flows from the Lola Park Tributary, estimated at approximately 1,200 cfs. A portion of these flows cross into Old Town at Green Street along Grace, Frances, Ethel, Dorothy, and Cora Avenues, inundating the majority of the Old Town east of Grace Avenue before ponding at the UPRR near Elm Street.</p>
                    <p>As with the other tributary areas, the lack of formalized crossing structures in the upper portions of the watershed  also effects the Eastern Tributary. The 2-5’x3’ crossing of County Road 46 is insufficient, causing roadway overtopping before flows are eventually collected by Ehrlich Lake, along with the Lola Park Tributary spills. Combined, these discharges cause Ehrlich Lake to spill west across S. Alice Avenue, where they parallel the UPRR embankment to a low point near the end of Elm Street. There is no crossing structure at this location, causing runoff to spill across the UPRR to the east. These spills inundate Aragon Court and the intersection of Broad Street and Alice as they travel north, where insufficient cross-drainage capacity at the Platte/Thompson Ditch causes ponding. Once they overtop the Ditch, they flow overland across farmland, potentially inundating the few homes along N. Alice Avenue.</p>

                  <p style="padding-top:15px;">Due to the low development density in the Northern Tributary areas, and the general lack of infrastructure, no flood hazards were identified in the Northern Tributary.</p>

                  <p style="padding-top:15px;">Flood hazards within the Big Thompson Tributary are mostly caused by spill flows from the Lola Park and Eastern Tributaries, or by insufficient conveyance capacity along N. Alice Avenue. The Eastern Tributary outfall channel parallels the east side of N. Alice. Roadway and canal crossings are insufficient to convey 100-year discharges, causing roadway overtopping. Roadway spill flows generally flow east, inundating farmland in the Tributary. The UPRR embankment west of Settler’s Village causes a large impediment to flows. This embankment spills in several locations, including near County Road 46, causing shallow flooding in the southern portion of Settler’s Village. Runoff from subwatershed 836 is also blocked by a UPRR embankment.</p>

        <h4 id="section44">4.4 Previous Analysis</h4>
                  <p>This report incorporates the results of the 1982 stormwater master plan. Information from the previous study was used to identify flood hazards and evaluate the impacts of the updated future conditions hydrology to determine problem locations.</p>
                  <p>The 2013 Flood Recovery Floodplain and the effective FEMA Flood Insurance Study were also considered in this analysis.  However, the hydraulic analyses on the Big Thompson and Little Thompson rivers within those State and Federal products are not re-evaluated in the local stormwater master plan.  Those studies are referenced and used to define the boundary condition between local and regional flood hazards.  This study benefited from the currency of the flood hazard determinations on the regional flood sources.  Typically local or regional data is temporally superior to the other.</p>

    </div>
            <h4 id="section51">5.1 Alternative Development Process</h4>
                  <p>Once the drainage problem areas were identified, alternatives were developed in order to mitigate flooding potential and implement the project details set forth by the Town of Milliken. These goals include:</p>
              <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>100-year conveyance of stormwater, including at roadway crossings</li>
                <li>Increased detention to mitigate changes in hydrology</li>
                <li>Improved water quality</li>
                <li>Recreational &amp; maintenance access</li>
              </ul>
                  <p>Several broad alternative categories were studied in order to minimize the drainage problem areas within the Town. Not all categories were considered for every reach, due to conditions specific to each tributary. Categories include:</p>
              <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>100-year conveyance with detention</li>
                <li>100-year conveyance without detention</li>
                <li>Floodplain preservation</li>
                <li>No improvements recommended </li>
              </ul>
                  <p>Generally, the 100-year conveyance with detention alternative favors the use of regional detention ponds to minimize required stormwater conveyance, whereas 100-year conveyance without detention alternative relies on larger storm sewer outfall systems to convey discharges. Water quality treatment is included in each detention pond. Property acquisition is generally included on an as-needed basis, either through easements or full acquisition in order to accommodate required stormwater infrastructure. Floodplain preservation was considered in areas where future development may encroach into existing floodplains or streams.</p>
                  <p>The design and evaluation of the conceptual alternatives was based on criteria set forth in the UDFCD Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual and the Flood Plain Information, Drainage Plan and Street Improvement Plan at Milliken, Colorado.</p>
              <h4 id="section52">5.2 Alternative Hydrolugy &amp; Hydraulics</h4>
                  <p>As shown in Table 3.3, the future conditions hydrologic analysis resulted in large increases in the 100-year discharge throughout Town, due to additional development expected south of Town. In order to mitigate these changes in the hydrology, a baseline hydrologic model was created. Based on current development practices, it is expected that as these areas develop, they will be required to provide detention areas sufficient to reduce developed discharges to a level at or below the historic major and minor storm discharge. The baseline hydrologic model includes detention areas sized to reduce future discharges near the existing level on a watershed-by-watershed basis. These ponds are inclusive to each alternative studied, and may not represent the total detention volume required to completely offset the increase in runoff volume or downstream runoff rates expected with future development.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>Following the baseline hydrologic analysis, downstream conveyance structures were sized to convey the baseline 100-year runoff event. Normal depth calculations were performed to estimate channel sizes. Open channel sections were assumed to be trapezoidal, with 3:1-4:1 side slopes, in order to minimize required right-of-way (ROW). Flow depths were limited to 5-feet during the 100-year event. Roadway crossings in urbanized areas were sized to convey the 100-year discharge without overtopping. Outside of the urbanized areas, such as across County Road 42, roadway crossings were sized to convey the 10-year discharge, assuming the roadway would be armored to withstand overtopping during the 100-year event. Table 5.2 shows a comparison of the baseline flows to the capacity of the existing infrastructure in the Town.</p>
              <h4 id="section53">5.3 Alternative Cost Estimates</h4>
              <p>In order to develop cost estimates for each alternative, the UD-MP Cost v2.1 spreadsheet was used. This spreadsheet was developed by the UDFCD for use on master planning projects. Estimated costs for construction of proposed improvements are based on UDFCD, CDOT and other agencies bid tabulations for units at a similar quantity.  Unit costs were brought to current year using the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) Construction Cost Index (CCI). At the time of this report, the most recently published CDOT CCI was from the second quarter of 2014. Cost estimates for each tributary have been broken down into capital costs and annual operations and maintenance costs. Capital improvements include structural measures, right-of-way, engineering, administrative, contract administration, and a contingency. Table 5.3 summarizes the unit costs from the UD-MP Cost spreadsheet. Costs not shown in the table, such as asphalt patching or other municipal hardscaping or utility costs associated with drainage infrastructure construction, were based on CDOT’s 2013 Cost Data Book.</p>
              <p>Quantities were based on proposed alternative alignments, using the project mapping and aerial photography. Drainage easements were identified in locations where improvements are recommended, but ownership would remain private. Property acquisition was recommended where easements would encumber large portions of each impacted parcel. Property acquisition costs were derived from Weld County Assessor’s data. Easement costs were calculated at 50% of actual sales property value.</p>
              <p>It was assumed that canal crossings could be installed using traditional open-cut methods, while railroad crossings would be jacked or bored. Costs for pipe jacking were obtained from recent project bid tabulations.</p>
              <p>Limited utility research was conducted to determine conflicts and relocation needs. In general, it was assumed that water lines could be relocated around proposed improvements where conflicts occurred. A lump sum cost of $20,000 was assumed for each waterline relocation. Dewatering was estimated at 1% of the capital cost for each alternative.</p>

                  <p style="padding-top:15px;">Drainage deficiencies in the Western Tributary relate mainly to the lack of canal crossing structures and insufficient storm sewer capacity for the 100-year event. Uncontrolled discharges pond against the Little Thompson Ditch embankment and spill into Frank Farms, inundating homes and streets. The following alternatives were considered for the Western Tributary.</p>

                        <p>This alternative will provide 100-year conveyance in S. Quentine Avenue through detention and upsizing of the existing storm sewer in Quentine from Green Street to S. Lilac Street. It includes the construction of an 8 acre-foot detention pond south of Frank Farms to collect runoff prior to spilling over the Little Thompson Ditch. A 60” pipe will pass under the canal, and replace the existing storm sewer from Lilac to Green. It will connect to the existing 60” pipe at Green Street, which has sufficient capacity to convey the 100-year event. Property acquisition will be required in order to construct the proposed detention area.</p>
                        <p>Capital improvement costs for this alternative are estimated at $3,000,000.</p>
                        <h4><u>100-year Conveyance without Regional Detention</u></h4>
                        <p>This alternative proposes a cutoff channel above the Little Thompson Ditch to route runoff around the west side of Frank Farms, which conveys discharges to the Little Thompson River. It will require approximately 3,500 feet of open channel, including a crossing of the Little Thompson Ditch and roadway crossings at Green and Broad Streets, in addition to easement or property acquisition. Since the Beeline Ditch and the Little Thompson River are separated by less than 100 feet at the proposed channel outfall, an overflow weir will be provided to help separate flows between the Ditch and the River. The outfall channel can also serve as future conveyance for the Purvis development west of Frank Farms. This alternative will also alleviate flooding in Quentine, since SWMM modeling indicates that the existing storm sewer is sufficient to convey local discharges.</p>
                        <p>Capital improvement costs for this alternative are estimated at $1,500,000.</p>

                    <p style="padding-top:15px;">In the Lola Park Tributary, drainage problem areas are typically caused by lack of conveyance infrastructure or insufficient capacity of the existing drainage system. Development has encroached onto the natural flow path of the tributary, blocking or obstructing runoff from the tributary. The following alternatives were considered during the alternatives analysis.</p>

                        <p>This alternative includes the provision of cross-drainage structures higher in the basin to reduce roadway overtopping and related maintenance, since many of these county roads lack crossing structures. In order to help reduce costs along the Lola Tributary, 10-year crossing structures are proposed higher in the basin, in currently undeveloped areas, at County Road 42 and County Road 44. Riprap armoring is proposed to prevent damage to the roadway embankment during the 100-year event.  A 100-year crossing is proposed at S. Quentine Avenue to provide emergency access in the event of a large storm. This will also help direct runoff to the Pheasant Hills pond.</p>
                        <p>Just downstream of Quentine, runoff enters the Pheasant Hills pond. However, a small irrigation ditch just south of the pond intercepts a portion of this runoff. This ditch embankment will be removed or ditch rerouted to allow the entire Lola Park discharge to enter the Pheasant Hills pond, and a drop structure is proposed to safely allow flows into the pond. Providing a formalized outlet structure will help control discharges and reduce surface flooding due to spill flows. In addition to providing a formal outlet structure, this alternative also increases the detention volume of the Pheasant Hills pond to approximately 233 ac-ft, in order to reduce 100-year discharges to a level below the existing conditions, reducing the required downstream conveyance infrastructure. This will also require raising a portion of the berm around the northeast corner of the pond. Since the Pheasant Hills pond falls under state jurisdictional requirements, any improvements to the impoundment must be approved by the Colorado State Engineer’s Office.</p>

              </div>
                    <p>An outfall channel is proposed downstream of the Pheasant Hills pond to convey discharges in a controlled manner, including a crossing structure of the Hillsboro Canal and a 100-year crossing structure at S. Irene Avenue and County Road 46. As noted above, the Lola Park Tributary flows have historically divided near this location, with the vast majority spilling towards Ehrlich Lake. Due to this, the decision was made to divert the entire 100-year detained discharge at this location to Ehrlich Lake, since the detained flows are less than what has historically been diverted to this location. This will also lessen required infrastructure along the Lola Park Tributary through the Town. A 100-year crossing structure is also proposed at S. Alice Avenue, before flows outfall into Ehrlich Lake.</p>
                    <p>Even with the diversion of upstream flows, drainage deficiencies still exist on the Lola Park Tributary in Old Town. Crossing structures at Forest, Elm, and Broad Streets, and the fire station culvert, remain undersized for the 100-year event. Therefore, an additional detention pond is proposed just upstream of Lola Park. This will provide approximately 15 ac-ft of detention storage, and will include water quality treatment. It will also reduce outflows to a level such that the existing infrastructure from Broad Street to Lola Park is sufficient to convey the 100-year discharge.</p>
                    <p>Downstream of Broad Street, the lack of formal drainage infrastructure causes flooding of the adjacent mobile home parks.  A 100-year storm sewer is proposed from Broad to the Platte/Thompson Ditch. Finally, an additional 54” pipe will be required at the UPRR to convey the entire 100-year discharge without overtopping the railroad.</p>
                    <p>Gravity flow constraints and historic permitting requirements will restrict the range of improvements to the Platte/Thompson Ditch.  Hydraulic conveyance under or over the ditch will be limited by specific design and permitting parameters.  Therefore, detention of inflows between Broad Street and the Platte/Thompson Ditch will require specific design to maximize hydraulic head for conveyance under the ditch, but also limit depth of ponding to ensure safety and compliant adjacent land uses.  Alternative analysis has found that a combination of stormwater flows under and over the Platte/Thompson Ditch can safely convey Lola Tributary flows downstream.  This likely results in a piping of the Thompson/Platte Ditch.  Siphoning the ditch was considered, but discouraged based on the limited hydraulic head that presently exists at that section of the ditch.</p>
                    <p>Additional ponding depth upstream of the railroad is a preferred alternative to the permitting and construction constraints of adding additional railroad culverts.  However, the existing culverts and upstream topography will limit the ponding to essentially the existing low areas upstream of the railroad.  A secondary embankment will be required as the railroad embankment is not designed to withstand asymmetrical hydraulic loads.</p>
                    <p>Capital costs for this alternative are estimated at $14,200,000.</p>
                    <h4><u>100-year Conveyance without Regional Detention</u></h4>
                    <p>This alternative is similar to the 100-year conveyance with detention scenario, with the exception of larger pipe crossings and outfall channels. Upstream of the Pheasant Hills pond, the proposed alternative is identical, since the discharges are the same. Since the Pheasant Hills pond will not be improved, 100-year discharges from the pond will increase due to an anticipated increase in stormwater runoff volumes. Costs for this alternative do not include an increase in detention volume at this location, however, an outlet structure is proposed, in order to help channelize flows across the Hillsboro Canal. The flow split at S. Irene Avenue and CR23 will be eliminated by channelizing flows towards Alice Avenue, in order to reduce required conveyance through the Town.</p>
                    <p>The existing roadway crossings at Forest, Elm, and Broad Streets are all insufficiently sized to convey 100-year discharges through the Town in this alternative. This will be alleviated by increasing conveyance capacities at these crossings.  Downstream of Broad, a proposed storm sewer should extend to the Platte/Thompson Ditch, in order to prevent inundation of Josephine Street. A transition structure will cross under the canal and outfall to a proposed channel which conveys flows to the existing crossing of the UPRR, which will be upgraded to convey 100-year discharges.</p>
                    <p>Total capital costs for this alternative are estimated at $11,700,000.</p>
                    <h4><u>Floodplain Preservation</u></h4>
                    <p>Floodplain preservation along the Lola Park Tributary is recommended in the upper portion of the watershed. From County Road 42 to the Pheasant Hills pond, the existing drainageway is well defined, and will be required to convey discharges from future developments. Setbacks or drainage easements are recommended to maintain this stream corridor, which appears to support a healthy riparian system.</p>

                        <p>Detention at the Pheasant Hills pond has reduced the inflow to Ehrlich Lake, however, SWMM modeling indicates that the lake will still overflow due to the lack of conveyance across the UPRR. Therefore, regional detention ponds are proposed near Alice and Green Street (extended) and also downstream of Centennial Farms, in order to further reduce inflows to Ehrlich Lake. New crossing structures will be required at Alice (at Centennial Farms) and County Road 46. A new culvert is proposed at Ehrlich Lake to provide the required conveyance capacity under the UPRR, eliminating overtopping at Ehrlich Lake. This culvert will extend to Broad Street, where the existing outfall channel will convey flows to the Big Thompson River.  According to SWMM modeling, the existing outfall channel along Alice has the capacity to convey the 100-year detained discharges, however, the crossing structures do not. Therefore, a series of box culverts are recommended at each crossing, in order to provide 100-year conveyance capacity.</p>
                        <p>Capital costs for this alternative are estimated at $20,500,000.</p>

                    <p>This alternative proposes the improvement of crossing structures at Alice Avenue (at Centennial Farms), County Road 46, the UPRR, and the crossings downstream of the UPRR in order to alleviate flood hazards in the Eastern Tributary. At Ehrlich Lake, the main cause of flooding is the lack of conveyance capacity under the UPRR. A new outlet structure is proposed to prevent the lake from overtopping Alice to the west.  An open channel is proposed from the UPRR to the intersection of N. Alice and Broad Street. North of Broad, new culverts will be required at the 4 existing crossing locations – Cherry Street, the Platte/Thompson Ditch, CR48, and N. Alice Avenue. </p>

                  <p style="padding-top:15px;">Flood hazards in the Big Thompson tributary are mainly caused by spill flows from the Lola Park and Eastern Tributaries. Discharges in this tributary are generally controlled by Centennial Lake and the Settler’s Village south pond. Future detention will be required in subwatershed 836, which has been accounted for in the baseline hydrology.</p>

            <h4 id="section61">6.1 Plan Description</h4>
              <p>The engineer’s recommended plan is outlined below. For an illustration of the plan, see Figure 6.1 below and the online map: <a href="../milliken-stormwater.html">../milliken-stormwater.html</a>. This webpage can be transferred to a city based website at any time.</p>
              <p><b>Western Tributary: 100-Year Conveyance without Detention</b></p>
              <p>The recommended plan for the Western Tributary is 100-Year Conveyance without Detention. It was selected on the basis of cost and its multi-use benefits, which include conveyance capacity for future development. In addition, conveying runoff in the proposed open channel will provide a water quality benefit to the reach.</p>
              <p><b>Lola Park Tributary: 100-Year Conveyance without Detention, Lola Park Pond, Pheasant Hills Outlet Structure, Floodplain Preservation</b></p>
              <p>The recommended plan for the Lola Park Tributary is 100-Year Conveyance without Regional Detention, due to the anticipated cost of the proposed detention ponds. It also minimizes potential land acquisition. Some elements of the ‘with Regional Detention’ alternative are also included, in order to reduce overall plan costs. For instance, the construction of the Lola Park pond, estimated at approximately one million dollars, will reduce discharges through Town. Proposed improvements required to convey the non-detained discharges are estimated at nearly three million dollars. Therefore, the construction of the Lola Park Pond will reduce the cost of conveyance improvements through Town by approximately two million dollars. Formalizing detention at Pheasant Hills through the construction of an outlet structure and raising its northeast berm will also significantly reduce downstream flows, resulting in a cost savings for the Eastern Tributary.</p>
              <p>This recommendation is congruent with existing flood recovery plans.  The downstream end of Lola Tributary is co-located with regional flood hazards from the Little Thompson River.  Regional flood mitigation can be designed to provide the highest benefit cost when it doubles as an effective outlet for local stormwater.</p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-9">
              <p><b>Eastern Tributary: 100-Year Conveyance without Detention</b></p>
              <p>For the Eastern Tributary, the recommended plan is 100-Year Conveyance without Regional Detention. The recommended plan reduces potential land acquisition and detention costs within the tributary. With the inclusion of the Pheasant Hills outlet structure, flows in the Eastern Tributary have been reduced, resulting in additional savings to the ‘without regional detention’ alternative shown above.</p>
              <p><b>Northern Tributary: No Improvements Recommended</b></p>
              <p>No improvements are currently recommended for the Northern Tributary.  Individual development will be responsible for on-site detention and water quality requirements.</p>
              <p><b>Big Thompson Tributary: No Improvements Recommended</b></p>
              <p>Since most flood hazards in this tributary are caused by deficiencies in other tributaries, no improvements are recommended for the Big Thompson Tributary. Hazard areas will be improved through increased conveyance capacity in the Eastern and Lola Park Tributaries.</p>

            <h4 id="section62">6.2 Water Quality Impacts</h4>
            <p>Since there are currently few stormwater BMP’s in the Town of Milliken, the recommended plan will help increase water quality. As the upper portions of the watershed develop, the detention areas shown in Table 5.1 will treat runoff from new developments. The implementation of these detention areas will ensure that the majority of the Lola Park Tributary is treated for water quality, and much of the Western and Eastern tributaries will also be treated. The recommended plan generally favors open channel flows, for instance, the Western Tributary cutoff ditch, which also help increase water quality.</p>
            <h4 id="section63">6.3 Operations and Maintenance</h4>
            <p>Maintenance and inspection is an essential part of all studied alternatives. In order for the proposed alternative to function properly, conveyance capacities must be maintained. The deposition of sediment in pipes, open channels, and detention areas reduces the effectiveness of the improvements and increases the probability of flood damages throughout the study area. Yearly and long-term maintenance costs have been included in each cost estimate.</p>
            <p>Since there is currently relatively little drainage infrastructure in the Town of Milliken, it is likely that the additional regional improvements recommended herein will increase required maintenance within the Town. However, these facilities will reduce flooding and flood-related damages in the Town, reducing maintenance and clean-up activities associated with flooding.</p>
            <p>It is recommended that future channel alignments include maintenance access trails incorporated into the cross-section. These trails greatly increase maintenance access while providing multi-use benefits for residents of the Town.  Equipment, manpower, and permit authority are other considerations of the operation and maintenance of the recommended improvements.  Existing equipment and manpower should be evaluated as recommended improvements are designed.  For instance, is the maintenance access width compatible with the Town’s existing equipment?  Permit authority is an administrative process to ensure Town work is compliant with building, environmental, and floodplain ordinances.  The existing Town ordinances provide for emergency operation and maintenance, but should be evaluated for allowance of routine maintenance.</p>
            <h4 id="section64">6.4 Environmental and Safety Assessment</h4>
            <p>Implementation of the selected plan will reduce peak flow rates, reduce flood hazards and flooded areas, and increase emergency access through reduced street flooding. The construction of open channels will also improve environmental and recreational conditions throughout the watershed, thereby enhancing neighborhoods.</p>
